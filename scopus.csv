MNOs with diverse physico-chemical properties and ability to encapsulate and deliver active ingredients in controlled, targeted and stimuli responsive manner can enhance the efficiency while minimizing collateral damage to non-target organisms and environment. Application of MNOs in the form of nanopesticides and nanofertilizers is known to affect soil microbial communities both positively and negatively, but detailed studies with varying dose, type and environmental conditions are scarce. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the complex mechanisms and factors which shape the MNOs-microbial interactions through integrating state of the art technologies including omics (transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics), artificial intelligence, and statistical frameworks. Lastly, we propose the idea of MNOs-mediated manipulation of soil microbiome to modify the soil microbial communities for improved microbial services. These microbial services, if harnessed appropriately, can revolutionize modern agriculture and help in achieving sustainable development goals. © 2023 The Author(s)","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149063433"

The Z generation’s green buying habits and purchase intentions are being reshaped by social media, which is helping to advance the development of a sustainable environment. The consumption of non-organic products has raised carbon emissions, so changing consumption patterns and purchase intentions is necessary for a more sustainable future. Moreover, earlier literature has the absence of a comprehensive behavior change model that explains the mechanism through which social media influences sustainable behaviors This study explores that how social media affects patterns of consumption for Z generation of China while considering the role of environmental concerns, subjective norms, eco-branding and eco-labeling on the basis of theory of planned behavior. A questionnaire is used to get information from the 563 Z generation respondents of China. The data is analyzed using Smart-PLS and empirical outcomes show that social media has a statistically significant influence on shaping and affecting green consumption behavior of China’s Z generation because it has the potential to reach a vast audience and spread awareness about environmental issues, leading to increased intention towards a sustainable environment and reduction in carbon emissions. It also provides a platform for individuals to express their opinions and engage in discussions on environmental issues. These developments are promising for the future of environmental sustainability as they indicate a growing interest in preserving the planet among the Z generation of China. It can be recommended as a policy tool that government and other organizations should support the development of informative content on social media platforms, highlighting the importance of environmental sustainability and ecofriendly habits.

Coastal zones are one of the areas thought to be most sensitive to current and future climate change threats. The paper integrates Remote Sensing (RS), Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques, and Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to detect vulnerable areas from climate change impacts in coastal zones in order to recommend adaptation systems in new coastal zones that can withstand various climatic changes. The proposed decision-making framework was developed in three phases: 1) climate data collection and processing; 2) Coastal Climate Impact Assessment (CCIA) model development; and 3) implementation and adaptation system selection. The climate data collection and processing phase involves determining the most significant climate change parameters and their indicators that affect coastal zone stability, extracting climatic data indicators from different climate database sources, and prioritizing the selected indicators. The indicators’ weights were estimated using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) through a questionnaire survey shared with experts in climate change impacts. A CCIA model development phase involves the formulation of the proposed model using GIS technique to discover the vulnerable areas according to the most dominant impact. The implementation and adaptation system selection phase involves the application of the framework to Al-Alamein New City in Egypt. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to measure the behavior of several climate change parameters to identify the most critical parameter for climate change in Al-Alamein New City. The results showed that the geology of the region is the most crucial component influenced by climate change. It is capable of producing a very sensitive area in the coastal zone while also taking other factors into account. When creating new urban neighborhoods, the erosion of the shoreline is the least important factor to consider. This is because coastal deterioration is caused by both the influence of metrological data on the region and the impact of human activity. Shoreline deterioration will be reduced if climate conditions are maintained while limiting the impact of human activities. To adapt to the long-term effects of climate change on coastal zones, a combination of soft and hard protection systems should be considered. © 2024, The Author(s).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182220000"

Despite the development of various discharge forecasting models, real-time projections are still difficult. This has necessitated the application of Artificial Intelligence to predict river discharge using satellite data since there is paucity of gauged records in most developing countries. In this research, a 38-year data, obtained from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Goddard Space Flight Center using the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2), was used to model the discharge of five selected rivers from South Eastern Nigeria watershed. Deep Neural Networks (DNN) modeling technique was engaged. Back propagation learning algorithms of various network topologies were developed for predicting the river’s discharge with respect to other hydrological properties. The developed model was trained and validated with the raw dataset. Results indicated that relative humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, rainfall intensity, radiation, air temperature, and soil temperature govern the discharge of river. The DNN model accurately predicted the river discharge with the 7–25-25–25-1 network structure, as evidenced by 99.91, 99.62, and 99.01% R for the training, validation, and test. The results of this analysis showed that DNN approach is effective at forecasting river discharge with respect to the hydrological characteristics. Decision-makers in the water and environmental sectors can utilize this knowledge in making an informed sustainable development plan. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182159382"

It is significant to explore the development and evolution trend of residential carbon emissions research for mitigating global climate change. However, there have been no studies that comprehensively review this research field. Based on the research papers on residential carbon emissions included in the Web of Science core database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure database, the CiteSpace bibliometric analysis software was used in this paper to draw the visual knowledge map of residential carbon emissions research and reveal its research status, research hotspots, and development trend. We found that residential carbon emissions research has gone through the stage of “emergence–initiation–rapid development”, and the research in the United States and the United Kingdom has played a fundamental role in developing this research field. Research hotspots mainly focus on analyzing energy demand, quantitative measurement, and impact mechanisms of residents’ direct and indirect carbon emissions and low-carbon consumption willingness. The focus of research has gradually shifted from qualitative analysis based on relevant policies to the analysis of quantitative spatiotemporal measurements and drive mechanisms of direct and indirect carbon emissions from residential buildings, transportation, and tourism based on mathematical models and geographic information system technologies. Modern intelligent means such as remote sensing technology and artificial intelligence technology can improve the dynamics and accuracy of this research, but there are few related types of research at present. Based on these research status and trends, we proposed that the future research direction of residential carbon emissions should focus more on spatial analysis and trend prediction based on intelligent methods under a low-carbon background. © 2023 by the authors.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147811106"

For example, the United States sends ∼150 million tons of waste to landfills, which is composed of over 75% organic and recyclable materials having a potential to be diverted to alternative scenarios. The emergence of an automated upstream and downstream sorting process for solid waste to increase material diversion from landfills is a promising approach for creating sustainable SWM. The utilization of artificial-intelligence-enabled smart and automated systems at the home and industrial scales, comprehensive public re-education including awareness of the adverse effects of landfilled waste on the ecosystem, and more eco-friendly product development are required to significantly reduce landfills and their negative footprint. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172726264"

As the last-guaranteed technology to reduce carbon emissions, carbon capture and storage (CCS) is emerging and has the potential to become an important choice to mitigate the greenhouse effect in the future. Forward-looking project deployment and accurate forecasting techniques occupy an indispensable position in CCS. Machine learning (ML), one of the fastest developing intelligent technology fields at present era, is considered as a substantial means to realize forecast demand relying on computer science and data statistics. This work provided a comprehensive review of ML applications in CCS, based on classical ML methods and mainstream research directions in CCS. The study shown that ML algorithms such as artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) were widely used, mainly for predicting physical properties, evaluating mechanical stability, and monitoring CO2 plume migration and leakage during CO2 storage. Support vector machine (SVM) was generally combined with other ML methods for the prediction of petrophysical properties and sensitivity analysis of influencing factors. Deep learning (DL) algorithms, represented by generative adversarial network (GAN) and long short-term memory (LSTM), had shown good results in real-time monitoring of CO2 migration and leakage. Decision tree (DT) and random forest (RF) were mainly used to establish risk assessment and decision analysis framework, and estimate the success probability of CCS. This review summarized the applications of ML algorithms in CCS and presented the challenges and future prospects, from the geoscience perspective. The findings of this work can help for better understanding of the key role played by ML in CCS, as well as guiding the selection of ML algorithms and the development of new models in CCS research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140097907"

Methods: Based on panel data of Chinese cities from 2006 to 2020, this paper used econometrics to investigate the impact and mechanism of digital technology on carbon emissions. Results: The results showed that digital technology can significantly reduce carbon emission intensity and improve carbon emission efficiency. These results remained robust after changing the estimation method, adding policy omission variables, replacing core variables, and solving the endogeneity problem. Digital technology can indirectly reduce carbon emissions by promoting green technological innovation and reducing energy intensity, and it plays a significant role in the carbon emission reduction practices of carbon emission trading policies and comprehensive national big data pilot zones. The replicability, non-exclusivity, and high mobility of digital technology help to accelerate the spread of knowledge and information between different cities, which leads to a spillover effect on carbon emission reductions. Our unconditional quantile regression model results showed that digital technology’s carbon emission reduction effect continuously decreases with increases in carbon dioxide emissions. Discussion: The results of this paper provide evidence for the potential use of digital technology in achieving the goal of carbon neutrality, which is of great significance for achieving high-quality innovation and promoting the green transformation of the economy and society.

The CALI inventory enables the investigation of the impact of the student experience in an active learning classroom by distinguishing the factors that characterize the structure, social learning, and inclusive practices. The Structure Index includes components related to course setup, organization, assessment, grading, and communications. The Sociality Index includes components related to opportunities for students to interact with each other. The Inclusiveness Index includes components related to how the instructor communicates a sense of belonging to the students through a growth mindset and inclusive policies and practices. A CS Mindset Instrument was developed based on research that measured students' self-efficacy by evaluating the extent of variation in their self-perceived ability to accomplish a task, sense of belonging in computing, and professional identity development. Demographic data is collected that allows for an analysis using an intersectional lens to acknowledge the complexity of social and cultural contexts. The knowledge and mastery assessments capture changes in competency through pre-post mastery quizzes. The combination of CALI with other instruments, including those that characterize student mindset, identity, and levels of mastery, enables investigation of how various practices of inclusive and collaborative active learning have differential effects on students with different identities in computer science. © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182982886"

To address this, developing crop varieties with increased productivity and tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses is crucial. Breeders must identify traits to ensure higher and consistent yields under inconsistent environmental challenges, possess resilience against emerging biotic and abiotic stresses and satisfy customer demands for safer and more nutritious meals. With the advent of omics-based technologies, molecular tools are now integrated with breeding to understand the molecular genetics of genotype-based traits and develop better climate-smart crops. The rapid development of omics technologies offers an opportunity to generate novel datasets for crop species. Identifying genes and pathways responsible for significant agronomic traits has been made possible by integrating omics data with genetic and phenotypic information. This paper discusses the importance and use of omics-based strategies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and phenomics, for agricultural and horticultural crop improvement, which aligns with developing better adaptability in these crop species to the changing climate conditions. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180837702"

In many regions, hydropower is called to counterbalance the temporal variability of intermittent renewables like solar and wind. However, using hydropower to integrate these renewables can affect aquatic ecosystems and increase cross-sectoral water conflicts. We develop and apply an artificial intelligence-assisted multisector design framework in Ghana, which shows how hydropower’s flexibility alone could enable expanding intermittent renewables by 38% but would increase sub-daily Volta River flow variability by up to 22 times compared to historical baseload hydropower operations. This would damage river ecosystems and reduce agricultural sector revenues by US$169 million per year. A diversified investment strategy identified using the proposed framework, including intermittent renewables, bioenergy, transmission lines and strategic hydropower re-operation could reduce sub-daily flow variability and enhance agricultural performance while meeting future national energy service goals and reducing CO2 emissions.

Importantly, the second edition examines how, over the last 10 years, research has both changed focus and where it is conducted. This shift essentially depicts ""a tale of two worlds""—one half (Western Europe, North America) moving away from coal and coalbed gas research and production towards cleaner energy resources, and the other half (Asia–Pacific region, Eastern Europe, South America) increasing both research and usage of coal. These changes are marked by a precipitous fall in coalbed gas production in North America; however, at the same time there has been a significant rise in coal and coalbed gas production in Australia, China, and India. The driver for higher production and its associated research is a quest for affordable energy and economic security that a large resource base brings to any country like Australia’s first large-scale coalbed gas to liquid natural gas projects supplying the demand for cleaner burning LNG to the Asian-Pacific region. Since the last edition of this book, global climate change policies have more forcibly emphasized the impact of methane from coal mines and placed these emissions equal to, or even more harmful than, CO2 emissions from fossil fuels in general. Governmental policies have prioritized capture, use, and storage of CO2, burning coal in new highly efficient low emission power plants, and gas pre-drainage of coal mines. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries and China are also introducing new research into alternative, non-fuel uses for coal, such as carbon fibers, nanocarbons, graphene, soil amendments, and as an unconventional ore for critical elements. New to this edition: Each chapter is substantially changed from the 1st edition including expanded and new literature citations and reviews, important new data and information, new features and materials, as well as re-organized and re-designed themes. Importantly, three new chapters cover global coal endowment and gas potential, groundwater systems related to coalbed gas production and biogenic gas generation as well as the changing landscape of coal and coalbed gas influenced by global climate change and net-zero carbon greenhouse gas emissions. FOREWORD When I reviewed the first edition of this book, my initial thought was, ""Do we need another book on coal geology?"" and then I read it and realised, ""Yes, we need this book"" and my students downloaded copies as soon as it was available. So now we come to 2023, and a lot has happened in the past decade. For a different reason we might ask if we still need this book, or even coal geoscientists and engineers, as the world aims for rapid decarbonisation of the energy sector and a reduction of coal as a feedstock for industrial resources, like steel manufacture. Natural gas is earmarked as a transition fuel to enable the shift to renewables. In some basins, the source of that gas is directly from coalbed gas production or from conventional reservoirs that were charged by coal and terrestrial organic source rocks. Although the transition is escalating, there are projections that coal will remain part of our future, even after 2050, and can also provide alternative non-fuel resources (e.g., critical elements and carbon-based nanomaterials). Between now and then, we’d best ensure that we extract and utilise coal and coalbed gas as efficiently and safely as possible, that we mitigate any environmental and social impact of the process, and that we improve our certainty of predicting the behaviour of the material and material impacts. To do this we need to understand coal as a material and the inherent variability of its quality and behaviour as a source rock and host of coalbed gas. One can change the technologies but not the geological ground conditions or coal character of the targeted resource. The authors have taken on this ambitious endeavour during their careers and have attempted to capture their knowledge gained from first-hand experience in countries around the world and comprehensive review of published material, within this book. At least three generations of knowledge are drawn upon here. Tim Moore was a student of both Romeo Flores and his supervisor John Ferm, who was the ""Warrior of Gentleness"" when it came to coal research, teaching, and supervision. This book also reflects the broad and multidisciplinary aspects of coal geology and coal science and provides the tenets for one to understand different disciplines and how they interact to form an integrated view of the resource—technically, economically, and politically. Each chapter takes the reader through different concepts, first setting the scene by examining the status of coal and coalbed gas in a carbon-conscious world, then looking at the science behind coal as a source of gas and as a reservoir- in its own right. Further reading leads to learning about geological settings and the processes through time that led to present-day endowments around the globe and this theme continues throughout the book with detailed examples from different countries. Personally, I like the emphasis on the depositional environments that lead to peat accumulation and preservation—it’s all about the ingredients—which leads nicely into the world of coal macerals and minerals, and why they matter. Coalification and its role in changing the chemistry and material properties of coal is covered from a reservoir perspective, as is the role of biogenic processes. These have produced some of the enormous gas resources we exploit today and could also provide a future circular economy for neo-biogenic gas. The role of groundwater in this past and potentially future endeavour is presented, along with possible adverse effects where there is unexpected communication with regional and local aquifers and surface assets that detract from environmental and social licence. In addition to describing the geology and engineering technologies required to explore for, access, and utilise these resources, the book also provides insights into geostatistical and economic modelling for reserves estimation and challenges as reservoirs become more geologically and politically complex for extraction and alternatively, for injection and carbon sequestration. The final chapters revisit and integrate concepts presented in the book in order to examine global gas production and the geographic shifts in production and research that have occurred over the past decade(s). The also show how government and the market play a role, and project future trends. The authors provide discussion points for the outlook of coal as a fuel feedstock in a carbon-constrained world and the ongoing search for options and alternative non-fuel uses of coal while highlighting the important role that coal and coalbed gas still play during the transition period and beyond. There is much to learn from this book, which is based on decades of observing and interpreting patterns and trends in coal and coal-bearing basins. There is a growing trend towards using machine learning and artificial intelligence to find patterns in data and provide solutions. I’d suggest that domain intelligence, such as that provided in this book, is critical to supervising this process and is required for understanding and validating the outputs upon which many decisions are made and will continue to be made in the future. So yes, we need this book and I invite you to read, learn, and form your own ideas. If you find any gaps—write about them. Joan S.

Herein, we present a comprehensive conceptual framework for the cognitive soil digital twin, which embodies the intricate physical reality of the soil ecosystem, aiding in its holistic monitoring and comprehension. The digital twin can seamlessly integrate a multitude of sensor data sources, including field Internet of Things sensors, remote sensing data, field measurements, digital cartography, surveys, and other Earth observation datasets. By virtue of its duality, this digital counterpart facilitates data organisation and rigorous analytical exploration, unravelling the intricacies of physical, chemical, and biological soil constituents while discerning their intricate interrelationships and their impact on ecosystem services. Its potential extends beyond mere data representation, acting as a versatile tool for scenario analysis and enabling the visualisation of diverse environmental impacts, including the effects of climate change and transformations in land use or management practices. Beyond academic circles, the digital twin’s utility extends to a broad spectrum of stakeholders across the entire quadruple helix, encompassing farmers and agronomists, soil researchers, the agro-industry, and policy-makers. By fostering collaboration among these stakeholders, the digital twin catalyses informed decision-making, underpinned by data-driven insights. Moreover, it acts as a testbed for the development of innovative sensors and monitoring frameworks, in addition to providing a platform that can educate users and the broader public using immersive and innovative visualisation tools, such as augmented reality. This innovative framework underscores the imperative of a holistic approach to soil ecosystem monitoring and management, propelling the soil science discipline into an era of unprecedented data integration and predictive modelling, by harnessing the effects of climate change towards the development of efficient decision-making. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180671788"

Microorganisms are potential alternative food sources that can help close the gap in food production. For the development of more efficient and yield-enhancing products, it is necessary to have a better understanding on the underlying regulatory molecular pathways of microbial growth. Nevertheless, as microbes are regulated at multiomics scales, current research focusing on single omics (genomics, proteomics, or metabolomics) independently is inadequate for optimizing growth and product output. Here, we discuss digital twin (DT) approaches that integrate systems biology and artificial intelligence in analyzing multiomics datasets to yield a microbial replica model for in silico testing before production. DT models can thus provide a holistic understanding of microbial growth, metabolite biosynthesis mechanisms, as well as identifying crucial production bottlenecks. Our argument, therefore, is to support the development of novel DT models that can potentially revolutionize microorganism-based alternative food production efficiency. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189032143"

However, theoretical consensus regarding climate risk insurance remains elusive, and the implementation of climate insurance policies varies markedly between countries owing to various challenges. This study conducted bibliometric analysis of 1082 relevant publications (1975–2022) to determine the theoretical basis, evolution of research hotspots, and methodologies associated with climate risk insurance. Climate insurance publications are growing at an average annual rate of 8.9%, with more than 2333 authors from 1103 organizations in 78 countries publishing on the subject. On the basis of milestones of global climate change assessment, i.e., the publication of the Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, climate insurance research can be divided into three major phases. In the start-up phase (1975–2007), research schemes examined the feasibilities and potentials of the National Flood Insurance Program in the United States, and the socioeconomic implications of transferring climate risk through reinsurance. The methodologies used in these studies were relatively simple owing to lack of comprehensive data. Research on flood insurance increased rapidly during the development phase (2008–2014), with increasing emphasis on the possibility of developing a flood insurance market in the Netherlands. Studies utilized catastrophe modeling and probabilistic approaches to estimate natural disaster losses and financial impacts. The boom phase (2015–2022) involved more research on the affordability of climate risk insurance given income inequality. The topic of climate insurance and the scope of its impact have developed global and interdisciplinary characteristics in terms of journal, sector, and disciplinary base. In the future, a trend might develop whereby big data will be combined with artificial intelligence and machine learning to design and implement index insurance. © 2023 The Authors","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168735491"

Research has been conducted to understand and model the effects of climatic conditions on watermain breaks. However, review studies to map the knowledge development in this area, to identify key achievements and limitations of previous studies are missing, and are addressed in this study. This review uses a mixed systematic and scientometric analysis to establish the research trends, contributions, methods, and covariates employed by previous studies related to climatic impacts on watermain deterioration. Web of Science and Scopus database is primarily employed to identify 70 relevant studies on the subject matter. These studies have been mostly conducted by institutions based in Canada, USA, and Europe. There is a general lack of collaboration among different institutions conducting research in this area. Studies in the subject matter are published from 1982 onwards, however, significant number of studies per year can only be noticed from 2005 onwards. Previous studies have been mostly focused on the modelling of watermain failure and have used statistical methods, and data-driven and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches for failure modelling of watermains under climatic conditions. For testing and validation of research data, studies have employed correlation analysis, performance evaluation metrics, and descriptive statistics. Typically, climate-related variables used in studies include temperature, moisture, and precipitation. Reviewed studies have considered cold (66%), hot (31%), and dry (13%) climatic conditions. Studies have investigated watermains made of metal (56%), plastics (43%), and Concrete and Asbestos cement (31%). Future studies are recommended to consider Data-driven and AI approaches in research design; pay attention to watermains in climatically vulnerable and massively populated regions; and consider climate risk assessment and the impact of climate change and extreme weather conditions on watermains. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85158012306"

These phenomena represent a risk for cultural heritage conservation, with negative consequences for local economies. To move from the analysis of climate impacts to adaptation measures and governance tools, it is necessary to deal with the different characteristics of the urban context in its physical, historical, cultural, and socio-economic components. The paper focuses on the collaboration between UNIGE Architecture and Design Department (DAD), and Colouree S.r.l. that has developed an analytical platform that uses artificial intelligence, geo-referenced data, and automated analysis to define the characteristics of the urban context. The aim of the research is the identification of parameters and solutions to respond to the effects of climate change in the urban environment, considering risk levels and context settlement; alongside the climatic skills, also the architects’ skills in environmental technologies, urban landscape, and cultural heritage have been given relevance. DAD aims to capitalize on the previous and ongoing experiences of Colouree, offering scientific and methodological support, to reach the definition of a detailed settlement analysis, providing indications on the risks associated with the main predictable effects (extreme weather events, heat island effect, water availability). The expected results will define a methodological structure to create a sensitivity mapping to meteorological phenomena, based on the data support from Colouree towards the carrying capacity of the urban fabric, making information more accessible thanks to the data visualization and web-based mapping, including, among the stakeholders, not only experts but also professionals and citizens. © 2023, The Author(s).","Book chapter","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163990384"

The combination of advancements in precision agriculture technologies development with application of artificial intelligence algorithms in agriculture decision making will help scientists and farmers to develop and implement decision support systems for early warning applications for weather and disease/pests attacks. This could lead to reducing the negative impacts of agriculture industry on environment through enforcing and adopting mitigative strategies to minimize effects of climate change on crop production.

The loss of native forests results in increased net emissions of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, thus enhancing the greenhouse effect of global warming. Additionally, deforestation jeopardises biodiversity conservation and the complex ecological balance of native wildlife with its surrounding ecosystems. The use of uncrewed autonomous vehicles (UAVs) to deposit seed aggregates has been trialled globally as a means for regenerating tree cover in remote areas. Such use is purported to obtain high seed-deposition rates, impressive germination rates of seeds and decreased labour costs; moreover, UAVs equipped with appropriate sensors can be beneficial in the post-planting analysis of seed success, from the early germination stages to canopy development. Once site data are collected, artificial intelligence, particularly machine-learning algorithms, can be used to process captured images through the stages of data preparation, feature extraction, model training and predictions. The segmentation techniques commonly involve implementation of either watershed-related algorithms or convolutional neural networks. The use of machine learning in characterising tree parameters has been found to improve speed, accuracy and reliability compared with traditional imaging processing techniques. This review reports on the use of UAVs in forestry, particularly reforestation in remote landscapes in Australia. It summarises the use of UAV technology in the deployment of seeds through to the monitoring of reforestation sites and explores trends in these. It discusses the benefits and challenges of the UAV-assisted monitoring of reforestation sites and future trends in this area. © 2024 The Author(s).

This understanding can help guide countries in developing better energy policies that are designed to reduce C02 and equivalent emissions, while still promoting economic growth and development. To reach the global climate goals set by the United Nations [25], countries must take decisive action to reduce emissions from fuel consumption and energy production while promoting clean energy, which can help mitigate the effects of climate change. Understanding the magnitude of the emissions problem is necessary before coming up with innovative, long-lasting solutions to better comprehend the issue of emissions. An important first step in achieving this understanding is to accurately assess the current levels of emissions from fuel consumption and energy production in a certain country and analyze the amount of these emissions and finally implement strategies to reduce them. Using machine learning technologies such as predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence can help create meaningful insights into the data to understand patterns in emissions that could enable better strategies for reducing emissions. Using a dataset that belongs to the Canadian government, with input data including engine size, number of cylinders, and fuel consumption, an ANFIS model was created to predict emissions. The amount of emissions represents the output. A variety of membership functions were tested in order to gain the best results. Another dataset was generated by applying the Extra-Trees regressor algorithm to the mentioned dataset and retraining the ANFIS model using the generated dataset to achieve better results. The resulting model can then serve as a trustworthy tool to support the application of efficient mitigation strategies and to inform and help policymakers.  © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182514132"

This research first establishes a Multi-universe Quantum Harmony Search-Algorithm Dynamic Fuzzy System Ensemble (MUQHS-DMFSE) composite model for carbon emission prediction. This model combines the MUQHS algorithm with the DMFSE method by designing the workflow of the MUQHS algorithm, creating a DMFSE composite prediction model, introducing a sliding factor matrix, and using the MUQHS algorithm to search for the optimal sliding factors, thus obtaining optimized prediction values. In the research on low-carbon economic development, the research applies the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method and establishes Charnes-Cooper-Rhodes (CCR) and Banker-Charnes-Cooper (BCC) models to assess the technical efficiency, pure technical efficiency, and scale efficiency of decision-making units. This research also uses the BCC model to project the production frontier and calculate input redundancy and output gap rates, and evaluate low-carbon economic development. Through the establishment and application of these two models, the research achieves carbon emission prediction and low-carbon economic analysis, validating the feasibility of the research methodology. The results show that the composite model can effectively predict carbon emissions, with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) below 3.5% and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) below 200 tons, demonstrating the feasibility and accuracy of the model. The research on low-carbon economic development in S Province based on the DEA method reveals the need for energy structure adjustment, clean and renewable energy promotion, control of carbon emissions, and optimization of industrial structure with a focus on developing the tertiary industry. Therefore, the use of artificial intelligence and big data analysis can provide more precise insights into the trends and patterns of low-carbon economic development, as well as more effective predictions of future energy demand and resource supply, offering high practical value and scientific significance.  © 2013 IEEE.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182381541"

However, in the beginning of 2022 the world has met new challenges and risks brought by the new geopolitical situation after the start of the war of Russia in Ukraine. The event resulted in the immediate disruption of many logistic channels, the consequences of which are beyond prediction at the moment. Even after the military activities cease it may take significant time to restore the disrupted connections. The study is based on the use of qualitative comparative analysis that identifies the impact of digitalization on the subsectors of the transport industry. The purpose of the study is to analyze the impact of the main digital transformation tools, as well as other impact factors (decarbonization, changes in behavioral stereotypes, COVID-19, etc.) on the development of transport: road, rail, sea and air transport. The transport industry is viewed through the lens of “Mobility as a Service” (MaaS). The research is focused on revolutionary changes in the development of the industry, which will result in structural changes in value added chains, shifts in the geography of the deployment of production facilities, the further spread of electronic document flow and payments, the growth in the use of electric cars and autonomous vehicles, robotization of warehouses and port infrastructure, the introduction of the Internet of Things in traffic control. The result of the study was the conclusion that the digitalization process in transport will develop, having an impact on other sectors of the economy. It was determined that these processes are irreversible, and companies engaged in transport operations and those working in related fields must adapt to changes: develop their own business models or adapt to existing ones. At the same time, the industry is only in the early stages of digitalization, the rate of changes and their consequences are not yet determined. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142429805"

This paper intends to provide a bibliometric analysis of nearly 30 years of urban flood resilience by mapping the knowledge domain, identifying evolving themes & trends over time, and extracting publications addressing urban flood resilience from the Scopus database. Trends, evolution, and mapping purpose of subject and field information analysis are undertaken using VOSviewer and SciMAT tools. The VOSviewer programme highlights the emphasis areas, whereas SciMAT traces the field’s intellectual evolution across time and the essential themes that drove the transition. The study period is divided into four segments: 1996–2005, 2006–2010, 2011–2015, and 2016–2022 based on the significant international policy milestones. The findings of the analysis highlight that the urban flood resilience field initially concentrated on a few themes and subsequently expanded to encompass the multi-dimensional characteristics of urban area resilience. In recent years, spatial planning approaches, nature-based and sustainable solutions, community-based and citizen science approaches, application of artificial intelligence, urban–rural relationship in resilience aspect, health services, and critical infrastructure networks have been the field's primary themes and concerns for achieving and assessing urban flood resilience. Despite a lack of emphasis on resilience assessment methods and approaches favouring conceptual framework and factors, it is observed that these themes are emerging in the developing scenario to solve the resilience concepts. The research may serve as a springboard for people's and policymakers' concerns about climate change and its effects, infrastructure development to improve the health and social well-being of societies, and a desire to learn more about resolving urban flooding problems in order to enhance flood management concepts pertaining to urban flood resilience and its history. Hence, a comprehensive list of themes and thematic areas concerning urban flood resilience with varying weights according to contexts is recommended, leading to the development of the urban flood resilient assessment tool and modifying the existing tools to reflect better the holistic understanding of sustainable and resilient cities/areas. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150716609"

As a key carbon-emitting industry, achieving net-zero carbon emissions in the manufacturing sector is vital to mitigating the negative effects of climate change and achieving sustainable development. The rise of intelligent technologies has driven industrial structural transformations that may help achieve carbon reduction. Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is an important part of digitalization, providing new technological tools and directions for the low carbon development of enterprises. This study selects Chinese A-share listed companies in the manufacturing industry from 2012 to 2021 as the research objects and uses a fixed-effects regression model to study the relationship between AI and carbon emissions. This study clarifies the significance of enterprise AI technology applications in realizing carbon emissions reduction and explores the regulatory mechanism from the perspective of the innovation effect. The results show that the application of enterprise AI technology positively impacts carbon emissions reduction. Simultaneously, green technological innovation, green management innovation, and green product innovation play moderating roles; in other words, enterprise green innovation strengthens the effect of AI on carbon emissions reduction. This study clarifies the necessity of intelligent manufacturing and enriches theories related to AI technology and carbon emissions. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85172285576"

The maritime sector is exploring the applicability of alternative powering options and ways to implement new technologies to increase safety and efficiency, to meet the regulations set by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO), and growth of the seaborne trade. Autonomous shipping is recognized by IMO as a path toward the implementation of new technologies with benefits in terms of safety, costs, and environmental impact. Based on the literature review, a research gap related to design requirements for power systems of autonomous ships is identified. Although the literature indicates that autonomous vessels are expected to be as safe as conventional ones, it is obvious that the removal of the crew from the ship leads to savings in operative costs, but at the same time, it significantly reduces the possibility for corrective maintenance during the voyage. Therefore, it is necessary to analyse key activities of the crew related to the operation of the ship power system and to define the effect of lack of crew on potential safety reductions. This paper aims to analyse differences between the power systems of conventional and autonomous ships and their role in safety assessment, as well as to provide a set of solutions for a successful transition from manned to unmanned ship power systems. © 2023 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169434516"

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has also been widely used in research, industry, and policy to assess systems' environmental sustainability. In this paper, we introduce a coupled ABM-LCA model to simulate mixed crop-livestock farming activities in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. The simulator considers a wide range of aspects related to typical farming business activities and allows the calculation of the environmental and economic impacts of the decisions taken by agents as well. The paper simulates different scenarios. Scenario A is the baseline scenario. Scenario B considers reducing the stocking rate from 1.6 to 1.3 livestock units per ha (LSU/ha). Scenario C aims to reduce the soybean ratio in animals’ feed rations to the minimum possible level that is feasible for each farm. Scenario D simulates an increase in soybean autonomy: the farmer chooses to adopt local soybean (instead of imported one) into the crop rotation if its green consciousness exceeds a pre-fixed threshold. As expected, in scenario B, all impact categories show improvement with respect to the baseline scenario, the highest ones being an almost 25% reduction in freshwater eutrophication, 21% in climate change - human health, and 19% in freshwater ecotoxicity. For natural land transformation, the most significant improvements are obtained in scenarios C (11% reduction) and D (13% reduction). On the other hand, in scenario C, the change in feed composition, combined with an expected decrease in stocking rates, also has a positive effect (about 16% reduction compared to the baseline) on agricultural land occupation, due to the utilization of pasture and locally produced crops. An analysis of the systemic uncertainty calculated at the endpoint indicators level showed low coefficients of variation (CV) for all the scenarios, with scenario A always having the lowest values of CV in every impact category, scenario C having the highest CV in the ecosystem quality and the human health categories and scenario B having the highest CV in the resources category. The consideration of subsidy schemes in the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg allows the modelers to better interpret the resulting revenue and cost structures of different scenarios. The results show that the farm profitability stays on the same level when the stocking rate is reduced, and the subsidy granted for reducing nitrogen emissions is in place at the same time. Moreover, the soybean autarky in Luxembourg can be increased to 17% if the farmers are willing to incorporate soybean into their rotation scheme, thus reducing the impacts due to the transportation and production of soybean in South American countries. © 2023 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145664974"

Although geological research of unconventional oil and gas resources has received much attention in recent years, such resources also face many complex geological and scientific problems. In this context, the 8th International Symposium on Hydrocarbon Accumulation Mechanisms and Petroleum Resources Evaluation was held in Beijing from 21 to 23 October, 2022. Experts presented and discussed their latest research findings on this topic relating to both conventional and unconventional oil and gas resources. They also discussed various development strategies for the petroleum industry taking into account the global objectives of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Six significant theoretical advances and some new technologies were introduced at this conference. These advances related to the “Whole Petroleum System” theory, shale oil and gas exploration, deep and ultra-deep petroleum exploitation, clean energy issues, and alternative types of unconventional oil and gas resources. In response to these technological advances, four major current challenges were identified. These challenges related to the petroleum industry’s ongoing growth and development in the context of carbon-neutrality goals, the evolution of hydrocarbon laws relating to petroleum accumulations and their exploitation, organic and inorganic effects on petroleum generation and accumulation mechanisms, and artificial intelligence applications related to hydrocarbon prediction. © The Author(s) 2023.","Short survey","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159430713"

This transformation is driven by the growing need for sustainable food production in response to the factors like population growth, climate change, and environmental degradation. Autonomation combines automation, robotics, drones, smart machinery, and AI to enhance agricultural processes, improving efficiency and reducing resource consumption through data-driven decision-making and precision farming practices. Industry-Agriculture 5.0 emphasizes human-machine collaboration, creating a cooperative relationship between humans and smart machines. This universal approach maximizes productivity while minimizing environmental impact. Case studies from different regions demonstrate the successful implementation of these technologies, resulting in improved crop yields, resource efficiency, and reduced environmental footprints. However, the adoption of these technologies brings challenges such as data privacy, cybersecurity, and access to technology for small-scale farmers. Striking a balance between technological advancement and ethical, environmental, and societal considerations is crucial for realizing a more sustainable and resilient agricultural future. This work recognizes the transdisciplinary nature of the problem, encompassing not only technological aspects but also economic, social, legislative, logistical, environmental, and smart city considerations.

Unfortunately, our resources seem inadequate to address the breadth of chemical challenges to the environment and human health. Therefore, it is important we use our intelligence and knowledge wisely to prepare for what lies ahead. The present study used a Delphi-style approach to horizon-scan future chemical threats that need to be considered in the setting of chemicals and environmental policy, which involved a multidisciplinary, multisectoral, and multinational panel of 25 scientists and practitioners (mainly from the United Kingdom, Europe, and other industrialized nations) in a three-stage process. Fifteen issues were shortlisted (from a nominated list of 48), considered by the panel to hold global relevance. The issues span from the need for new chemical manufacturing (including transitioning to non-fossil-fuel feedstocks); challenges from novel materials, food imports, landfills, and tire wear; and opportunities from artificial intelligence, greater data transparency, and the weight-of-evidence approach. The 15 issues can be divided into three classes: new perspectives on historic but insufficiently appreciated chemicals/issues, new or relatively new products and their associated industries, and thinking through approaches we can use to meet these challenges. Chemicals are one threat among many that influence the environment and human health, and interlinkages with wider issues such as climate change and how we mitigate these were clear in this exercise. The horizon scan highlights the value of thinking broadly and consulting widely, considering systems approaches to ensure that interventions appreciate synergies and avoid harmful trade-offs in other areas. We recommend further collaboration between researchers, industry, regulators, and policymakers to perform horizon scanning to inform policymaking, to develop our ability to meet these challenges, and especially to extend the approach to consider also concerns from countries with developing economies.

Macrophyte mass developments are, however, often perceived as a nuisance and are commonly managed by mechanical removal. This is costly and often ineffective due to macrophyte regrowth. There is insufficient understanding about what causes macrophyte mass development, what people who use water bodies consider to be a nuisance, or the potential negative effects of macrophyte removal on the structure and function of ecosystems. To address these gaps, we performed a standardized set of in situ experiments and questionnaires at six sites (lakes, reservoirs, and rivers) on three continents where macrophyte mass developments occur. We then derived monetary values of ecosystem services for different scenarios of macrophyte management (“do nothing”, “current practice”, “maximum removal”), and developed a decision support system for the management of water courses experiencing macrophyte mass developments. We found that (a) macrophyte mass developments often occur in ecosystems which (unintentionally) became perfect habitats for aquatic plants, that (b) reduced ecosystem disturbance can cause macrophyte mass developments even if nutrient concentrations are low, that (c) macrophyte mass developments are indeed perceived negatively, but visitors tend to regard them as less of a nuisance than residents do, that (d) macrophyte removal lowers the water level of streams and adjacent groundwater, but this may have positive or negative overall societal effects, and that (e) the effects of macrophyte removal on water quality, greenhouse gas emissions, and biodiversity vary, and likely depend on ecosystem characteristics and macrophyte life form. Overall, we found that aquatic plant management often does not greatly affect the overall societal value of the ecosystem, and we suggest that the “do nothing” option should not be easily discarded in the management of perceived nuisance mass developments of aquatic plants. © 2024 The Authors","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192143448"

MHWs have significant impacts on the marine environment, ecosystems, and economic livelihoods. In recent years, global warming has intensified MHWs, and research on MHWs has rapidly developed into an important research frontier. With the development of deep learning models, they have demonstrated remarkable performance in predicting sea surface temperature, which is instrumental in identifying and anticipating marine heatwaves (MHWs). However, the complexity of deep learning models makes it difficult for users to understand how the models make predictions, posing a challenge for scientists and decision-makers who rely on interpretable results to manage the risks associated with MHWs. In this study, we propose an interpretable model for discovering MHWs. We first input variables that are relevant to the occurrence of MHWs into an LSTM model and use a posteriori explanation method called Expected Gradients to represent the degree to which different variables affect the prediction results. Additionally, we decompose the LSTM model to examine the information flow within the model. Our method can be used to understand which features the deep learning model focuses on and how these features affect the model’s predictions. From the experimental results, this study provides a new perspective for understanding the causes of MHWs and demonstrates the prospect of future artificial intelligence-assisted scientific discovery. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192358725"

We identify two crucial opportunities that AI offers in this domain: it can help improve and expand current understanding of climate change, and it can contribute to combatting the climate crisis effectively. However, the development of AI also raises two sets of problems when considering climate change: the possible exacerbation of social and ethical challenges already associated with AI, and the contribution to climate change of the greenhouse gases emitted by training data and computation-intensive AI systems. We assess the carbon footprint of AI research, and the factors that influence AI’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in this domain. We find that the carbon footprint of AI research may be significant and highlight the need for more evidence concerning the trade-off between the GHG emissions generated by AI research and the energy and resource efficiency gains that AI can offer. In light of our analysis, we argue that leveraging the opportunities offered by AI for global climate change whilst limiting its risks is a gambit which requires responsive, evidence-based, and effective governance to become a winning strategy.

Therefore, their conservation and restoration are of fundamental importance for sustainable development. This study used a deep learning model for groundwater level prediction to evaluate a wetland restoration project implemented in the Kushiro Wetland in Japan. The Kushiro Wetland had been degraded due to river improvement work. However, in 2010, a wetland restoration project was carried out to restore the meandering river channel, and a decade has passed since its completion. In this study, the wetland restoration project was evaluated by comparing the response of the groundwater level using a model that reproduced physical conditions with different characteristics before and after the restoration. At first, a deep learning model was created to predict groundwater levels pre- and post-restoration of a meandering river channel using observation data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) was used as the deep learning model. The most important aspect of this study was that LSTM was trained for each of the pre- and post-restoration periods when the hydrological and geological characteristics changed due to the river channel’s restoration. The trained LSTM model achieved high performance with a prediction error of the groundwater levels within 0.162 m at all observation points. Next, the LSTM models trained with the observation data of the post-restoration period were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the meandering channel restoration. The results indicated that the meandering channel restoration improved hydrological processes in groundwater levels, i.e., their rainfall response and average groundwater water levels. Furthermore, the variable importance analysis of the explanatory variables in the LSTM model showed that river discharge and precipitation significantly contributed to groundwater level recovery in the Kushiro Wetland. These results indicated that the LSTM model could learn the differences in hydrological and geological characteristics’ changes due to channel restoration to groundwater levels. Furthermore, LSTM is a data-driven deep learning model, and by learning hydrological and geological conditions to identify factors that may affect groundwater levels, LSTM has the potential to become a powerful analysis method that can be used for environmental management and conservation issues. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151629524"

A renewable energy transition is believed to play a central role in mitigating the economic-climate paradox. While the architectural and computational power of artificial intelligence is particu larly well suited to address the challenges of massive data processing and demand forecasting during a renewable energy transition, there is very scant empirical assessment that takes a social science perspective and explores the effects of AI development on the energy transition. Purpose of the article: This paper aims to answer two key questions: One is, how does AI software development promote or inhibit the shift of energy consumption towards renewables? The other is, under what policy interventions does AI software development have a more positive effect on promoting renewable energy consumption? Methods: We employ a dataset of 62 economies covering the period 2011–2020 to analyze the impact of AI software development on the energy transition, where possible confounders, including political and economic characteristics and time-invariant elements, are controlled using fixed-effects estimation along with specified covariates. Findings & value added: AI software development can promote the energy transition towards renewables. There is suggestive evidence that the core mechanism linking such a positive relationship tends to lie in improving innovation performance in environmental monitoring rather than in green computing. Government support for R&D in renewable energy technologies is found to be significantly beneficial for harnessing the positive impact of AI software development on the energy transition. Compared to non-market-based environmental policies, market-based environmental policies have a more significant positive moderating effect on the relationship between AI software development and energy transition. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181094921"

Sustainable agriculture is necessary to solve this food security challenge. Disruptive technologies, such as of artificial intelligence, especially, deep learning techniques can contribute to agricultural sustainability. For example, applying deep learning techniques for early disease classification allows us to take timely action, thereby helping to increase the yield without inflicting unnecessary environmental damage, such as excessive use of fertilisers or pesticides. Several studies have been conducted on agricultural sustainability using deep learning techniques and also semantic web technologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs. However, the three major challenges remain: (i) the lack of explainability of deep learning-based systems (e.g. disease information), especially to non-experts like farmers; (ii) a lack of contextual information (e.g. soil or plant information) and domain-expert knowledge in deep learning-based systems; and (iii) the lack of pattern learning ability of systems based on the semantic web, despite their ability to incorporate domain knowledge. Therefore, this paper presents the work on disease classification, addressing the challenges as mentioned earlier by combining deep learning and semantic web technologies, namely ontologies and knowledge graphs. The findings are: (i) 0.905 (90.5%) prediction accuracy on large noisy dataset; (ii) ability to generate user-level explanations about disease and incorporate contextual and domain knowledge; (iii) the average prediction latency of 3.8514 s on 5268 samples; (iv) 95% of users finding the explanation of the proposed method useful; and (v) 85% of users being able to understand generated explanations easily—show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of performance and explainability and is also suitable for real-world scenarios. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165633499"

This has given rise to a new concept of energy exchange—the ability for consumers and producers to trade localized energy. This concept has been made possible by the emergence of blockchain technology, which has gained significant traction in the energy markets. Its unique ability to facilitate peer-to-peer (P2P) energy transactions has made it a promising solution for the trilemma of scalability, security, and decentralization. However, while blockchain technology has shown great potential, it is still in its early stages of development and has yet to reach its full potential. To fully understand the potential of blockchain technology in P2P energy trading, it is important to explore the trilemma in depth. This study proposes a blockchain-based scalability solution with a focus on P2P energy trading. This strategy is supported by empirical modeling, utilizing data gathered from a trial case study. The results of this study demonstrate that the suggested technique outperforms base-layer models in terms of scalability while still maintaining the essential elements of security and decentralization. This proposed solution not only has the potential to revolutionize the energy markets but also has broader implications. By providing a more secure and decentralized platform for P2P energy trading, it has the potential to address issues of energy distribution inequality and promote the adoption of renewable energy. With blockchain technology, individuals and communities have the opportunity to take control of their energy usage and production, reducing their reliance on traditional centralized energy systems. This not only has the potential to lower energy costs for consumers but also contributes to the overall goal of reducing carbon emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. The combination of rooftop solar panel technology and blockchain applications has the potential to create a significant shift toward decentralized and sustainable energy systems.

The global response to this problem must comprise transitions in land and ecosystems, energy, urban, infrastructure, and industrial systems and a transformation in enterprise and risk management. With the global pressure to fight climate change and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the innovative potential of Industry 4.0 technologies (blockchain, Big Data analytics, the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, 3D additive manufacturing and technology platforms) has been subject to enormous interest among researchers and practitioners. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated technology investment and digital transformation in many business areas, potentially including sustainability risk management. Purpose of the article: The purpose of this paper is to explore the scope of Industry 4.0 technology implementation in sustainability risk management and its financial impact. Methods: Based on the survey research, the authors verified if enterprises implementing Industry 4.0 technologies during the last five years are benefiting from their investment depending on the number of technologies. Due to the ordinal measurement scale of the analyzed variables, the verification of hypotheses was carried out using the Mann-Whitney U test. Findings & value added: In the opinion of the managers surveyed, the number of Industry 4.0 technologies implemented in the sustainability risk management process does not affect the enterprise’s aggregate Financial Performance Indicator, individual financial indicators (ROA, ROE, OPM, NPM and FLR) and the enterprise’s ability to manage financial risk. This study contributes to the literature on the technological transformation of the sustainability risk management process and its financial importance. The design and implementation of sustainable development strategies imply a long-term perspective, including the achievement of risk management effects in this area. The implementation of one technology, let alone two or more, is a difficult and time-consuming management challenge before synergy effects are achieved in an integrated technological eco-system. © Instytut Badań Gospodarczych / Institute of Economic Research (Poland).","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183093213"

Despite this, the safety and quality of food have been questioned in the aftermath of a long series of food frauds and food safety crises. Adding to the existing complexities related to food safety management and food fraud mitigation, calls for a stronger focus on sustainability have gradually increased in response to the negative effects of climate change and system shocks such as the COVID pandemic. These calls are exacerbated by claims of excessive water consumption for food animals and crops as well as toxic discharges. To meet the expectations of an expanding global population, there is an urgent need to leverage new technologies and embrace digital transformation in order to improve sustainability across the food industry. In this context, smart logistics emerges as an innovative paradigm for integrating novel technologies and realising the potential of cyber-physical systems to improve food logistics operations. Additionally, smart logistics has the potential to improve food chain transparency and ensure timely delivery of perishable food while increasing flexibility and improving efficiency. This chapter discusses emerging technologies that serve as a foundation for smart logistics and are critical enablers for the development of a sustainable food industry. It is primarily focused on a variety of food logistics operations, including warehousing, transportation, and distribution.

The small size, low cost, and low power consumption of sensors can facilitate obtaining the values of polluting gases in the atmosphere. However, several problems with using air pollution technique relate to various effects such as sensing accuracy, sensor drifts, and sluggish reactions to changes in pollution levels. Recently, machine learning has made it feasible to build a more intelligent, context-aware system that can anticipate events and monitor present conditions. This paper focuses on the use of environment sensors for detecting air pollution based on several types of wireless protocols, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, LoRa, Global Positioning System (GPS), and 4G/5G. Furthermore, it classifies previous published articles on the topic according to the wireless protocol and compared in terms of several performance metrics such as the adopted air pollution sensors, hardware platform, adopted algorithm, power consumption or power savings, and sensing accuracy. In addition, this work highlights the challenges and limitations facing drones during their mission for detecting air pollution. As a result, we suggest to build and implement at base station an intelligent system based on backpropagation (BP) neural networks, which provides flexibility to track and predict the true values of polluting gases in the atmosphere to overcome the above problems. Finally, this work addresses the advantages of using drones in the air pollution field. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85169756985"

Despite the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to acquire high-resolution data for vegetation analysis in Antarctic regions through artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the use of multispectral imagery and deep learning (DL) is quite limited. This study addresses this gap with two pivotal contributions: (1) it underscores the potential of deep learning (DL) in a field with notably limited implementations for these datasets; and (2) it introduces an innovative workflow that compares the performance between two supervised machine learning (ML) classifiers: Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and U-Net. The proposed workflow is validated by detecting and mapping moss and lichen using data collected in the highly biodiverse Antarctic Specially Protected Area (ASPA) 135, situated near Casey Station, between January and February 2023. The implemented ML models were trained against five classes: Healthy Moss, Stressed Moss, Moribund Moss, Lichen, and Non-vegetated. In the development of the U-Net model, two methods were applied: Method (1) which utilised the original labelled data as those used for XGBoost; and Method (2) which incorporated XGBoost predictions as additional input to that version of U-Net. Results indicate that XGBoost demonstrated robust performance, exceeding 85% in key metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score. The workflow suggested enhanced accuracy in the classification outputs for U-Net, as Method 2 demonstrated a substantial increase in precision, recall and F1-score compared to Method 1, with notable improvements such as precision for Healthy Moss (Method 2: 94% vs. Method 1: 74%) and recall for Stressed Moss (Method 2: 86% vs. Method 1: 69%). These findings contribute to advancing non-invasive monitoring techniques for the delicate Antarctic ecosystems, showcasing the potential of UAVs, high-resolution multispectral imagery, and ML models in remote sensing applications. © 2024 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85185883407"

A review of 147 Carbon Emission Prediction Model (CEPM) studies revealed three predominant functions—prediction, optimization, and prediction factor selection. Statistical models, comprising 75 instances, were the most prevalent among prediction models, followed by neural network models at 21.8 %. The consistent rise in neural network model usage, particularly feedforward architectures, was observed from 2019 to 2022. A majority of CEPMs incorporated optimized approaches, with 94.4 % utilizing metaheuristic models. Parameter optimization was the primary focus, followed by structure optimization. Prediction factor selection models, employing Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for statistical and machine learning models, respectively, filtered factors effectively. Scrutinizing accuracy, pre-optimized CEPMs exhibited varied performance, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values spanned from 0.112 to 1635 Mt, while post-optimization led to a notable improvement, the minimum RMSE reached 0.0003 Mt, and the maximum was 95.14 Mt. Finally, we summarized the pros and cons of existing models, classified and counted the factors that influence carbon emissions, clarified the research objectives in CEPM and assessed the applied model evaluation methods and the spatial and temporal scales of existing research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190256725"

Artificial intelligence and data mining could be used to provide solutions to reduce EP cases. As for Spain, there is no study addressing this characterization that could be significant in warmer zones of the country (i.e., the most exposed zones to climate change). Simulated energy consumption data were used with data of energy prices and family units' incomes based on the public income indicator of multiple effects (IPREM in Spanish). In addition, the high share of energy expenditure in income (2 M) was used to assess EP. A total of 36,230,400 cases were simulated to train and test 312 prediction models, 104 by each algorithm. The algorithms were multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF), and M5P. The results showed that these three algorithms were appropriate, with tree-type models obtaining better estimates. For greater effectiveness, prediction models should also be used for the income threshold considered in their development. The results also showed the utility of artificial intelligence in the prediction of EP without performing an energy analysis in detail, thus optimizing energy managers and social workers' work.

To address this paradox, explainable machine learning coupled with panel data models are proposed to examine the different performances of Cameroon, Zimbabwe, Ghana, and Eritrea in terms of environmental sustainability measured by visibility. The results show that all countries except Zimbabwe have inverted N-shaped Environmental Kuznets Curves (EKCs), suggesting that the economic development works against environmental sustainability. Based on the modified TOPSIS (Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution), Cameroon's environmental sustainability performance is particularly poor, while Eritrea's is better. Meanwhile, Eritrea is not exogenously threatened by epidemics, while Cameroon and Ghana are. By integrating the multidimensional Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) achievement pathway assessment system, Zimbabwe may be moving towards green growth. More importantly, the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) technique is applied to quantify and visualize the socio-economic drivers of environmental sustainability. The results depict that, in addition to meteorological drivers, per capita income plays a leading role. In conclusion, we can validate the contribution of artificial intelligence algorithms to the SDGs and employ a comprehensive method for assessing SDG performance linking environment, economy, and public health.

We leverage heterogeneous Earth Observation data and contribute a data-driven approach based on causal machine learning for understanding how crop diversification impacts may change in the future. We apply this method to the country of Cyprus throughout a 4-year period. We find that, on average, crop diversification significantly benefited the net primary productivity of crops, increasing it by 2.8%. The effect generally synergized well with higher maximum temperatures and lower soil moistures. In a warmer and more drought-prone climate, we conclude that crop diversification exhibits promising adaptation potential and is thus a sensible policy choice with regards to agricultural productivity for present and future. © Author(s) 2023.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183299841"

Due to climatic fluctuations, agriculture and food production system suffer serious problems caused by drought, floods, and upsurge of insect pest and diseases. Improved varieties produced by plant breeding are one of the most important ways to have stable production in the face of new challenges posed by climate change.

Accurate mapping of coastal salt marshes is always the first step for their protection, management, and restoration. The inherent complexities of vegetation, dynamics of tides, and anthropogenic disturbances pose challenges for remote sensing-based approaches. Existing studies have utilized phenology information and various black-box algorithms to reduce misclassifications. However, the approaches with dual-temporal images containing phenology information have suffered from inefficiency; the misclassifications have been objectively post-processed rather than considered in the method design, and the tacit knowledge of the trained black-box models has not been revealed. To address the above issues, we proposed a new approach with solid improvements in dual-temporal image construction, misclassification processing, and tacit knowledge analysis, including an efficient method to synthesize dual-temporal images based on the common divisor of the green-up season or senescence season resulting from latitudinal gradients in narrow coastal areas of China, a detailed classification scheme by interpretation of iteratively collected samples, and a key decision rule approximating the trained model. We applied the approach to Sentinel-1/2 images and DEM data, thus deriving a 10-m resolution coastal salt marsh map of China with an overall accuracy of 92.5%. A qualitative comparison showed that the map produced in this study was fitted well with actual salt marsh distributions, resulting in improved accuracy when compared to recently generated maps. The most important contribution is that the overall nature of the trained model observed from the training samples was approximated by a four-feature decision rule following the principle of explainable artificial intelligence, i.e., B8senescence/B4senescence < 2.06 & B4green/B8green < 0.78 & B12green/B11green < 0.72 & elevation < 2.13, and thus established a new potential classification mechanism for dual-temporal black-box algorithms, i.e., the water signal was covered up by flourishing vegetation, but the situation changed when vegetation withered. This study not only generates an accurate coastal salt marsh map at a national scale but also provides a classification mechanism for dual-temporal image-based coastal salt marsh identification and mapping. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161717919"

This research aims to forecast forest development and assess the relative consequences of varying rotation lengths on several ecosystem services such as wood production, habitat for biodiversity, carbon sequestration, water provision, soil protection and cultural values. Forest development is simulated with the ETCAP model to examine the long-term effects of various rotation lengths with silvicultural prescriptions on the ecosystem services. Bürücek forest planning unit is used as a case study area with 10,711 ha forests in upper Mediterranean region of Turkey. Shorter rotation lengths are considered one of the main mitigation measures to climate changes in forestry; however, lead to the increased harvest level, net present value, ground water and soil loss, and reductions in the largest stand volume, understory, basal area, carbon storage and the cultural values with less regulated forest structure. The management scenarios with longer rotation lengths, however, have highlighted improvements in the carbon storage, larger standing volume, mean stand age, basal area and cultural values, and reductions in the mean harvest volume, net present value, ground water and soil loss due to larger-even distribution of tree sizes and stand development stages. An aspiration for a higher level of provisioning services for economic motivations may need to be discarded for the sake of enhancing the capacity of forest ecosystems to sequester more carbon and provide better habitat condition for biodiversity conservation with a careful design and selection of rotation lengths. Overall, the choice of optimal rotation length is highly dependent on a desired set of management objectives and target forest structure driven mostly by management interventions with the appropriate type and level of ecosystem services, provided that a thorough understanding of forest dynamics is achieved by considering both risks and uncertainties associated with natural disturbances and socio-economic conditions. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85151781010"

However, the environmentalist have been researching this concept to benefit the environment to establish multidimensional discoveries of clean energy. An increase in greenhouse gases (GHGs) is caused by most human developmental activities. Direct or indirect emission of GHGs by person, group, event, or any other activity contributes to the carbon footprint. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, USA, major sources of increasing GHGs are transportation (29%), electricity (28%), industry (22%), commercial and residential (12%), and agriculture (9%). Vigorous effects are required to control the increasing GHGs by developing and implementing policies and utilizing new technologies. In this time of challenges presented by climate change, technological advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) or digital assistance have made a significant impact on people’s lifestyles. AI-based technologies to monitor, predict, and reduce GHGs emissions may help in a cleaner environment. This article aims to describe different AI-based approaches to minimize carbon footprints as well as discuss the role of AI in various industries and its economic and societal outcomes.

To support such efforts, it is essential to know what influences the choice of an EV over a traditional internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). To study this, a discrete choice experiment was developed, and 2,015 valid responses were gathered from Canadian adults with a driver’s license. In place of a more traditional analysis, a machine learning approach, XGBoost, was applied. However, two key issues were addressed with respect to its application. First, a practical question related to how best to split the training and testing data was examined. A new technique based on the Coyote optimization algorithm (COA) is developed that automatically determines the split that leads to the greatest prediction accuracy. The policy-relevant results of the analysis found that an individual’s Climate Change-Stage of Change (CC-SoC) and the price ratio of EVs to ICEVs are the most important direct influences. The interaction effect of the first two (CC-SoC and price ratio) is also influential. However, this leads to the second key issue: interpretability. Although high prediction accuracy (87.1%) was achieved, the black-box nature of the approach limits its policy relevance. As such, this research applied a technique, Accumulated Local Effects (ALE), that can determine the strength and direction of influence of the variable. This research demonstrates how machine learning can be applied to a policy-relevant question and provide information that is useful to policy decision makers. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177079926"

With climate change, investigating climate change impacts on Water-Energy-Food nexus has been a topic of growing interest in recent years. However, there is a lack of a systematic review of the current state and methodologies of Water-Energy-Food nexus studies under climate change. Here, we review research articles investigating climate change impacts on Water-Food, Water-Energy and Water-Energy-Food nexus over last seven years. The existing methods and tools, spatial scales, and future climate scenarios setting in these articles are summarised and analysed. We found that the analyses methods could be divided into four categories (physics-based modelling, statistical methods, supervised learning and operation optimisation), among them, physics-based modelling accounts for the largest proportion. The reviewed studies cover a range of scales from site scale to global, with most studies focusing on the regional scale. Models used for small to middle scale are mainly related to hydrology and water resource, while large-scale modelling is based on interdisciplinary models. Future climate scenarios setting include emission scenarios and global warming scenarios based on Global Climate Models (GCMs). A number of future research challenges have been identified. These include spatial scale and resolution, internal physical mechanism, application of novel artificial intelligence models, extreme climate events, potential competition in nexus systems as well as data and model uncertainty. © 2023, The Author(s).","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85179694564"

In the situation of water scarcity, the effective use of water is urgent for every sector, especially in Vietnam. A large areas of agriculture field in Vietnam is irrigated through branches of rivers where valve gates are installed to take water for irrigation channel. The existing operations of irrigation channels are based on human experience with assumption that water level at front of the channels is always sufficient. However, now a day, with the effect of climate change and the conditions of complicated agriculture activities, the river conveys water levels and flows to irrigation channels are so different, as it varies with short time interval. The use of control policy without predictive model therefore lacks reliability and affects on the irrigation planning. In addition, the operations of irrigation channel systems at different areas on the same river should be cooperated to ensure the goal of sufficient water supply.

The extensive data collection efforts to monitor and maintain the health of marine environments supports the efforts in data driven learning, which can help policy makers in making effective decisions. Machine learning techniques show a lot of promise for improving the quality and scope of marine research by detecting implicit patterns and hidden trends, especially in big datasets that are difficult to analyze with traditional methods. Machine learning is extensively used on marine science data collected in various regions, but it has not been applied in a significant way to data generated in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). Machine learning methods using ocean science data are showing encouraging results and thus are drawing interest from data science researchers and marine scientists to further the research. The purpose of this paper is to review the existing approaches in studying GOM data, the state of the art in machine learning techniques as applied to the GOM, and propose solutions to GOM data problems. We review several issues faced by marine environments in GOM in addition to climate change and its effects. We also present machine learning techniques and methods used elsewhere to address similar problems and propose applications to problems in the GOM. We find that Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs), hypoxia, and sea-level rises have not received as much attention as other climate change problems and within the machine learning literature, the impacts on estuaries and coastal systems, as well as oyster mortality (also major problems for the GOM) have been understudied – we identify those as important areas for improvement. We anticipate this manuscript will act as a baseline for data science researchers and marine scientists to solve problems in the GOM collaboratively and/or independently.

As a result, this industry has also been a key contributor to the disastrous changes in the environment and decay in biodiversity. Here, the idea of sustainability and environment protection essentially has various facets such as responsible consumption of natural resources and preservation of natural resources. Design/methodology/approach: There is a dire need for this sector to adopt sustainable business practices across functions and processes such as sourcing, production, overall supply chain management, packaging, retailing, and disposal. It also includes reducing the waste and curbing exploitation practices by deploying research-based inventions, innovative ideas, and digital technologies. This approach will help these fashion brands to support United Nations’ (UN’s) Sustainable Development Goals. Although numerous ways are available to achieve these goals, cutting edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), metaverse, machine learning, virtual reality, Internet of Things, augmented reality, and data analytics play a crucial role. This research endeavors to explore how these technologies can be leveraged by the fashion brands and retailers to evolve and improve on their efforts toward bringing sustainable and circular fashion for their customers. Findings and Practical Implications: Consumers are progressively more aware about the effects of climate emergency and are expecting fashion brands to place emphasis on sustainable business practices due to which the circular business models are no more optional, especially in the post COVID-19 world. Its highly likely that fashion brands that are embracing the circularity and adopting sustainable business practices using digital technologies such as AI are preferred by consumers especially by Generation Z and millennials and are hence expected to be more successful in the future. Originality/Value: This research endeavors to bring out practical recommendations for how the fashion brands and retailers can leverage the AI technologies for refining their processes and enhance the value proposition and brand credibility among their target audience. To conclude, this research is an endeavor to determine and underscore the plausible ways to achieve the targets set by UN’s Global Biodiversity Framework and accomplish the 2050 vision of “living in harmony with the ecological ecosystem.”. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Vikas Garg, Richa Goel, Pooja Tiwari, and Esra S.

Given the environmental problems connected to cement production, geopolymer concrete has become a viable alternative. In addition, if the concrete strength results failed to meet the specified strength after being cast, modifications are impossible. Thus, it is particularly desirable to predict strength prior to casting concrete. This study presents the first effort in applying deep neural networks (DNN) of AI techniques to predict the mechanical strengths (GGBFS) of geopolymer concrete (GPC) produced from corncob ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag. The mixes were activated with 12–16 M of alkali solutions at ambiently cured conditions for 7–90 days. Following that, back propagation learning algorithms were created for forecasting the concrete strengths based on concrete mix proportions. The mechanical strengths estimated by the DNN were verified by laboratory testing results. Results revealed that GGBFS, mix grade, curing days, and alkali precursor are variables that govern the mechanical strengths of the GGBFS-CCA-GPC. Forecasting the mechanical properties of GPC produced using DNN shows that the relationship between the input and output arguments could be most accurately predicted by a 10–20–20–20-1 network topology, evident by approximately 99% correlation coefficient between the actual and predictive values for compressive and flexural strengths. However, the 10–17–17–17-1 network architecture showed the best DNN for predicting split tensile strength, with a 97% correlation coefficient between the actual and projected values. This study demonstrated that the DNN techniques are efficient in predicting the mechanical strengths of GPC based on the mix proportions. Application of these techniques will greatly advance concrete quality assurance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85166945215"

It has become the need of the hour to act fast due to the alarming issues of unsustainability such as climate change, global warming, waste generation, environmental pollution, resource scarceness and ecological degradations. This research aims to investigate and model the CE enablers in the product development process related to the moderating effect of net zero. Design/methodology/approach: The significant CE enablers are identified through literature review and expert brainstorming. The Pythagorean fuzzy decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (PF-DEMATEL) technique has been used to investigate and evaluate the significant CE enablers in product development process. PF-DEMATEL determines the inter-relationship and casual dependency among the selected CE enablers. Indian automobile small and medium enterprises (SMEs) have been considered as a case organization to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Findings: The findings reveal that “Top management support and clear vision towards CE adoption” is the most important enabler and “Artificial intelligence in product value chain” is recognized as the least vital enabler. This research aids the managers, decision-makers, policy planners and workforce to develop and formulating efficient blueprints for the effective adoption of CE in Indian SMEs. Originality/value: This is the first kind of research that explores CE enablers in product development process for Indian SMEs. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Article","Article in press","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178876338"

Hybrid solar PV systems, which combine multiple energy sources and storage solutions, offer a promising avenue to improve the reliability and efficiency of renewable energy generation. This research focuses on the mathematical modeling, non-linearity characteristic analysis, and the development of efficiency enhancement strategies for hybrid solar PV energy systems. The study begins with the development of comprehensive mathematical models that accurately represent the complex interactions within hybrid solar PV systems. These models consider various factors, including solar irradiance, temperature variations, load profiles, and the dynamic behavior of energy storage components. The incorporation of non-linear characteristics, often overlooked in conventional models, allows for a more realistic representation of system performance. To enhance the efficiency of hybrid solar PV systems, a range of strategies are proposed and evaluated. These strategies encompass advanced control algorithms, optimized sizing and placement of energy storage elements, and the integration of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. The goal is to mitigate non-linear effects, maximize energy utilization, and improve system response to dynamic operating conditions. The findings from this research provide valuable insights into the design, operation, and performance optimization of hybrid solar PV energy systems. By addressing non-linearity characteristics and developing efficient strategies, this study contributes to the advancement of renewable energy technologies and fosters the transition towards a more sustainable and resilient energy future. © 2023, International Publications.

The PRIMA programme supported by Horizon 2020, the European Union Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, aims to reverse this situation. The SUPROMED project funded by PRIMA sought to develop an online platform composed of several models adapted to the requirements of end users for increasing the economic and environmental sustainability of Mediterranean agricultural systems. MOPECO, in its research version, was designed to maximize the profitability of irrigated farms in water-scarce regions. A simplified version of this model (MOPECO irrigation scheduling) was included in the SUPROMED platform for improving irrigation efficiency, providing farmers with a useful irrigation scheduling software. This paper shows the approach to adapt and transfer MOPECO to the productive sector. The tool was validated in three different demosite areas across the Mediterranean, involving local stakeholders in the design, validation, and dissemination of the software. The simplified tool reached similar or higher yields than farmers using less water. Thus, the average water saved was around 16%, while the average yield increased around 10% in the plots located in the three demosites of the project (Eastern Mancha in Spain, Bekaa valley in Lebanon, and Sidi Bouzid in Tunisia). This fact decreased the water footprint and increased the profitability of farms. The high applicability of the tool has generated interest among many technicians, farmers, and advisory enterprises. Furthermore, regional and national governmental extension services have shown interest in spreading the use of the tool across their territories, validating the methodology used for adapting and transferring a scientific model to the productive sector. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159213685"

The effects of climate change are evident, temperatures everywhere in the world are getting higher and violent weather phenomena are more frequent, requiring clear and firm pro-environmental measures. Thus, we will discuss the energy transition and the support provided by artificial intelligence (AI) applications to achieve a cleaner and healthier environment. The focus will be on applications driving the energy transition, the significant role of AI, and collective efforts to improve societal interactions and living standards. The price of electricity is included in almost all goods and services and should be affordable for the sustainable development of economies. Therefore, it is important to model, anticipate and understand the trend of electricity markets. The electricity price includes an imbalance component which is the difference between notifications and real-time operation. Ideally it is zero, but in real operation such differences are normal due to load variation, lack of renewable energy sources (RES) accurate prediction, unplanted outages, etc. Therefore, additional energy has to be produced or some generating units are required to reduce generation to balance the power system. Usually, this activity is performed on the balancing market (BM) by the transmission system operator (TSO) that gathers offers from generators to gradually reduce or increase the output. Therefore, the prediction of the imbalance volume along with the prices for deficit and surplus is of paramount importance for producers’ decision makers to create offers on the BM. The main goal is to predict the imbalance volume and minimize the costs that such imbalance may cause. In this chapter, we propose a method to predict the imbalance volume based on the classification of the imbalance sign that is inserted into the dataset for predicting the imbalance volume. The imbalance sign is predicted using several classifiers and the output of the classification is added to the input dataset. The rest of the exogenous variables are shifted to the values from previous day d − 1. Therefore, the input variables are either predicted (like the imbalance sign) or are known from d − 1. Several metrics, such as mean average percentage error (MAPE), determination coefficient R2 and mean average error (MAE) are calculated to assess the proposed method of combining classification machine learning (ML) algorithms and recurrent neural networks (RNN) that memorize variations, namely long short-term memory (LSTM) model. © The Author(s) 2024.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189564652"

With the challenges posed by climate change and increasing disturbances, as well as the complexities of salvage logging, there is a growing interest in understanding post-disturbance development in unsalvaged mountain forests, alongside the advancement of decision support systems aimed at ensuring sustained provision of ecosystem services. In this study, we combined a space-for-time substitution approach with long-term monitoring data to evaluate regeneration processes and development of deadwood decay following three distinct windthrow events in Central European mountain forests that were locally unsalvaged (specifically Vaia in 2018, Kyrill in 2007, and Vivian in 1990). Our unique dataset additionally provided insights into the long-term effects of disturbance legacies and tree regeneration on protection against natural hazards. Deadwood cover gradually decreased with time since disturbance, from an average of 50% two years after Vaia to 25% twelve years after Kyrill and 15% thirty years after Vivian. Similarly, deadwood height above ground significantly decreased over time, with median values dropping from 1 to 2 m immediately after the disturbance to 25–30 cm three decades later. The decay stage and diameter of deadwood significantly influenced tree regeneration, with larger diameters of logs and deadwood in more advanced decay stage (especially less solid/soft to very loose stage), facilitating seedling establishment, thus a second wave of tree regeneration. About a quarter of saplings grew on deadwood thirty years after disturbance. The analysis of post-windthrow stand development showed an increase in tree cover and height with time since disturbance, with distinct patterns observed across different windthrow events and sites. Three decades post-disturbance, the number of trees had notably increased, with tree cover reaching 50%. Although Norway spruce remained the dominant species, the forest composition had shifted towards a predominance of broadleaves, particularly evident at lower elevations and areas with moderate browsing pressure. Our findings underscore the critical role of post-disturbance forest recovery and deadwood dynamics in promoting uneven-aged mixed forest structures, thereby enhancing forest regeneration, structural diversity, and protection against natural hazards. Emphasizing the vital importance of retaining deadwood, our study suggests that its role as a valuable substrate for enhancing resilience and ecosystem services is likely to grow in the future. © 2024 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189935891"

Meanwhile, advances in artificial intelligence based financial management and the creation of new blockchains or cryptocurrencies have transformed the day-to-day operations of economic actors. The aim of the present study is to investigate the impact of financial management and blockchains on environmental sustainability and resource productivity. The monthly time series data of the United States of America economy data is used covering the period from 2000M01–2022M09. Firstly, the stationary variable is tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests. The findings reveal that all the variables follow I(1). The long-term estimations are investigated through the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares. The findings reveal that artificial intelligence-based financial management helps to improve environmental sustainability and resource productivity by reducing carbon emissions and increasing combustible and renewable waste, metals, and non-metallic minerals resources in the long run. In addition, blockchain technology appears to be a booster for environmental unsustainability while also reducing metallic resources. These findings are particularly important and critical since they indicate the path to achieving Sustainable Development Goals. Overall, the findings imply that the United States of America authorities should continue to push AI-based sustainability models and move to green blockchains in order to mitigate the negative environmental effects of blockchains. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160831185"

The COVID-19 epidemic and the Russia–Ukraine war caused a brief change in direct connectivity over quantiles. CEF consistently receives shocks from the system, while IRBO and ROBT transmit significant shocks to systems. The dynamic net pairwise directional connectivity in the context of quantiles demonstrates that the common eigen factor (CEF) mainly absorbs the influences of the three other variables, especially during COVID-19. This dynamic net pairwise directional connectivity across quantiles demonstrates how unknown events, such as the Ukraine–Russia conflict and the COVID-19 epidemic, affect investor mood as well as both environmentally unfriendly and environmentally beneficial cryptocurrencies.

To address these issues, the water sector is undergoing a digital transformation, leveraging digital technologies and methods, such as artificial intelligence and smart sensors, to improve sustainable supply, distribution, and treatment of water resources. Water supply systems are a crucial piece of the water industry which has the demanding task of collecting water, transporting it and distributing it to various users. An example of how digitalisation supports the suitable use of water is hereafter proposed through a real case study. Exploiting the digital information with a proper hydraulic model and an innovative control algorithm allows for enhancing the hydraulic and energy performance of the water supply systems analysed. In fact, accurate management of the pressure in the mountain distribution network leads to a significant decrease in water losses and also to reduced energy consumption. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171987329"

The framework combines flash flood modelling, statistical methods, artificial intelligence (AI), geographic evaluations, risk analysis, and decision-making modules to enhance community resilience. Flash flood is simulated by using Watershed Modelling System (WMS). Statistical methods are also used to trim outlier data from physical systems and climatic data. Furthermore, three AI methods, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and Nearest Neighbours Classification (NNC), are used to predict and classify flash flood occurrences. Geographic Information System (GIS) is also utilised to assess potential risks in vulnerable regions, together with Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Hazard and Operability Study (HAZOP) methods. The decision-making module employs the Classic Delphi technique to classify the appropriate solutions for flood risk control. The methodology is demonstrated by its application to the real case study of the Khosf region in Iran, which suffers from both drought and severe floods simultaneously, exacerbated by recent climate changes. The results show high Coefficient of determination (R2) scores for the three AI methods, with SVM at 0.88, ANN at 0.79, and NNC at 0.89. FMEA results indicate that over 50% of scenarios are at high flood risk, while HAZOP indicates 30% of scenarios with the same risk rate. Additionally, peak flows of over 24 m3/s are considered flood occurrences that can cause financial damage in all scenarios and risk techniques of the case study. Finally, our research findings indicate a practical decision support system that is compatible with sustainable development concepts and can enhance community resilience in arid regions. © 2023 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162081530"

Increasing the dimensions of offshore wind turbines to augment energy production, enhancing the power generation efficiency of existing systems, mitigating the environmental impacts of these installations, venturing into deeper waters for turbine deployment in regions with optimal wind conditions, and the drive to develop floating offshore turbines stand out as significant challenges in the domains of development, installation, operation, and maintenance of these systems. This work specifically centers on providing a comprehensive review of the research undertaken to tackle several of these challenges using machine learning and artificial intelligence. These machine learning-based techniques have been effectively applied to structural health monitoring and maintenance, facilitating the more accurate identification of potential failures and enabling the implementation of precision maintenance strategies. Furthermore, machine learning has played a pivotal role in optimizing wind farm layouts, improving power production forecasting, and mitigating wake effects, thereby leading to heightened energy generation efficiency. Additionally, the integration of machine learning-driven control systems has showcased considerable potential for enhancing the operational strategies of offshore wind farms, thereby augmenting their overall performance and energy output. Climatic data prediction and environmental studies have also benefited from the predictive capabilities of machine learning, resulting in the optimization of power generation and the comprehensive assessment of environmental impacts.

The digital transformation of crop production is part of a federal strategy aimed at adapting agricultural areas to climate change and obtaining a consistently high yield through the introduction of Industry 4.0 digital technologies and platform services. The software-algorithmic tools are presented to implement the method. The group of researchers considered a new approach to the adaptation of agricultural areas in the context of the greenhouse effect dynamics and proposed a new method of agro-ecological and natural-agricultural zoning of territories to increase the amount of crop yields. Practical implementation makes it possible to select evidence-based measures for zoning agricultural areas, thereby improving the efficiency of specific control actions for the adaptation of territories in terms of the greenhouse effect dynamics.

Design education responds, fostering responsible design through collaborations with new kinds of stakeholders, technologies and expert advisers. This is an example of such a multidisciplinary, design-led, innovation project, with some student output and learning outcomes, reflections and subsequent developments. In a Masters course that emphasises personal purpose for change-making in the world, and alongside other units focusing on designing with ethical, environment and social responsibility, this 3 week unit tasked MA/MSc students of Innovation Design with applying artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to human rights and humanitarian issues. The project brings expert insights, inspiration and guidance from fields of AI and ML, but also international criminal law & war crimes, collective intelligence, gamification, gender-based violence and people trafficking. The process and outcomes are shared as examples of rapid learning from an intensive activity, with little technical instruction and no primary user research. Here the designer acts for users and stakeholders outside of the consumer-corporate dynamic. The beneficiaries may be victims of human rights abuses and cannot ethically be included directly in research or testing by students.

This is a trend that we call “platformization.” It’s taken us to a point where we now live in what’s often described as a “platform society” because these platforms now largely control urban civilizations. What’s fascinating is that this platformization trend has created something pretty striking: the Metaverse. The Metaverse is an impressive global platform project launched by Meta, the company we used to know as Facebook. This project brings to life a potential “virtual world” that mirrors our reality. The idea is that the Metaverse can serve as a virtual version of the future cities – not too different from what we think of as smart cities. Thanks to cutting-edge technologies like Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, Internet of Things (IoT), and Digital Twins, we now have enough resources and understanding of human behavior to make a project like the Metaverse possible. The promise is that the Metaverse can revolutionize how we design cities and deliver public services, making cities more efficient, accountable, and with a higher quality performance. But of course, the arrival of the Metaverse isn’t without its worries. There are many questions over the ethical, human, social, and cultural implications the Metaverse may have. Particularly, there are concerns about the kind of impact it may have on the quality of human social relationships and how it may reshape urban life. To unpack all of these, this research work aims to thoroughly examine available literature on this topic. The paper further looks into the new products and services coming into being because of the Metaverse, examining how they might help smart cities, especially those aiming for better environment, economy, and social sustainability. The insights gathered here could help city leaders understand the Metaverse’s potential for technology-driven urban practices and future city plans. It also takes a critical stance, challenging whether the Metaverse might significantly change how reality is constructed in our increasingly platform-driven urban world. This discussion, hopefully, can fuel future research and critical conversation on this hot topic. © 2023 Copyright © 2023 Qadir et al., licensed to EAI.

With the increase in world population and the effects of climate change due to the industrialization of economies, food security systems are under pressure to sustain communities. This situation calls for the implementation of innovative solutions to increase and sustain efficacy from farm to table. Agricultural social networks (ASNs) are central in agriculture value chain (AVC) management and sustainability and consist of a complex network inclusive of interdependent actors such as farmers, distributors, processors, and retailers. Hence, social network structures (SNSs) and practices are a means to contextualize user scenarios in agricultural value chain digitalization and digital solutions development. Therefore, this research aimed to unearth the roles of agricultural social networks in AVC digitalization, enabling an inclusive digital economy. We conducted automated literature content analysis followed by the application of case studies to develop a conceptual framework for the digitalization of the AVC toward an inclusive digital economy. Furthermore, we propose a transdisciplinary framework that guides the digitalization systematization of the AVC, while articulating resilience principles that aim to attain sustainability. The outcomes of this study offer software developers, agricultural stakeholders, and policymakers a platform to gain an understanding of technological infrastructure capabilities toward sustaining communities through digitalized AVCs. © 2023 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85161621189"

In this paper, we present the development of a holistic framework, entitled HARMONIA, that encompasses State-of-The-Art solutions for the emerging issues related to Climate Change, natural and/or man-made hazards and urban/peri-urban risks. The Horizon 2020 HARMONIA project is developing an Integrated Resilience Assessment Platform (IRAP) which plans to provide targeted services for different groups of end-users. In particular, it will actively support urban decision-makers in strategic decisions and planning and citizens in facing daily effects and risks of Climate Change. Additionally, the platform will be a place to interconnect cities which end up facing similar Climate Change effects. HARMONIA IRAP leverages cuttingedge technologies (i.e., explainable Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining, multi-criteria analysis, dynamic programming) and services (ie., Virtual Machines, Containers) in order to provide solutions considering the complexity and diversity of extreme earth and non-earth data. In addition, this platform includes a Decision Support System providing early-warning feedback and recommendations to the end-users. In this way the HARMONIA IRAP design tends to address these challenges by offering the corresponding dynamic, scalable and robust mechanisms with the aim to provide useful integrated tools for the related users. Datacubes architecture, which is a major part of the IRAP, offers the opportunity to investigate more sophisticated correlations among the data and provide a more tangible representation of the extracted information.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146646101"

However, fully interactive atmospheric chemistry schemes needed for calculating changes in ozone are computationally expensive. Climate modelers therefore often use climatological ozone fields, which are typically neither consistent with the actual climate state simulated by each model nor with the specific climate change scenario. This limitation applies in particular to standard modeling experiments such as preindustrial control or abrupt 4xCO2 climate sensitivity simulations. Here we suggest a novel method using a simple linear machine learning regression algorithm to predict ozone distributions for preindustrial and abrupt 4xCO2 simulations. Using the atmospheric temperature field as the only input, the regression reliably predicts three-dimensional ozone distributions at monthly to daily time intervals. In particular, the representation of stratospheric ozone variability is much improved compared with a fixed climatology, which is important for interactions with dynamical phenomena such as the polar vortices and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. Our method requires training data covering only a fraction of the usual length of simulations and thus promises to be an important stepping stone towards a range of new computationally efficient methods to consider ozone changes in long climate simulations. We highlight key development steps to further improve and extend the scope of machine learning-based ozone parameterizations. © 2018 The Author(s).

In Hungary, annual temperatures have increased by 1.2 °C-1.8 °C in the last 30 years and the frequency of extreme droughts has grown. With the aim to gain stand-level prospects of sustainability, we have used local forest site variables to identify and project effects of recent and expected changes of climate. We have used a climatic descriptor (FAI index) to compare trends estimated from forest datasets with climatological projections; this is likely for the first time such a comparison has been made. Four independent approaches confirmed the near-linear decline of growth and vitality with increasing hot droughts in summer, using sessile oak as model species. The correlation between droughts and the expansion of pest and disease damages was also found to be significant. Projections of expected changes of main site factors predict a dramatic rise of future drought frequency and, consequently, a substantial shift of forest climate classes, especially at low elevation.

The impact of a natural disaster is a function of the type and magnitude of the hazard, and the vulnerability of the people and assets exposed to the hazard. Consequently, bushfire risk is not only a function of bushfire likelihood and intensity, but also the social vulnerability of affected communities. In this paper, a framework is presented that enables the spatial distribution of bushfire risk to be quantified by considering bushfire likelihood and social vulnerability. The framework also caters to the assessment of how this risk could change into the future in response to climate change and socio-economic development. The framework is applied to the case study of Greater Adelaide, South Australia. The current distribution of social vulnerability is calculated based on a number of indicators and the current distribution of bushfire likelihood determined using the Unified Natural Hazard Risk Mitigation Exploratory Decision Support System (UNHaRMED), enabling the spatial distribution of current bushfire risk to be determined based on social vulnerability. Plausible spatial distributions of future bushfire risk based on social vulnerability are obtained in response to a number of climate and socio-economic exploratory scenarios. The impact of climate change scenarios on bushfire likelihood is quantified with UNHaRMED. The impact of the socio-economic scenarios on social vulnerability is quantified using a combination of changes in the distribution of land use and population with the aid of UNHaRMED, as well as “clues” in the narrative scenario storylines about likely changes in factors affecting social vulnerability. The results indicate that future changes in social vulnerability are likely to affect long-term bushfire risk in greater Adelaide, with spatial distributions of social vulnerability and bushfire risk changing in different ways under different plausible future scenarios. This enables areas of emerging risk to be identified, opening the door to long-term risk-reduction strategies to be targeted to these high-risk regions. © 2021 Proceedings of the International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM.

However, global climate change and human activities have led to dramatic environmental changes severely affecting seagrass growth and development. Therefore, it is crucial to understand accurately how environmental changes, affect seagrass distribution. In this study, we selected the seagrass distribution area in Hainan, China, as the study area and proposed an ensemble model combining five machine learning models to predict the potential distribution of seagrass. Fifteen environmental variables were entered into the model, and the study results showed that the ensemble model provided the highest accuracy (Area Under Curve (AUC) = 0.91). The environmental variables were then classified into regional and site explanations with the help of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. The difference in the contribution of regional and site environmental variables is demonstrated, and the model provides a more reasonable explanation for the site. The Shapley value (SHAP) and Partial dependency plot (PDP) analysis methods explain the importance of environmental variables in the seagrass distribution model and the effect of multiple environmental variable interactions on the prediction results, which implies opening the black box model for machine learning. More evidence that explainable artificial intelligence can explain the effects of environmental variables in seagrass distribution models will help to improve environmental understanding in seagrass conservation processes. © 2022 The Author(s)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139298036"

The Kunlun Mountain glacier and its glacial melt water are the most important water resources in western China, and are of great significance to maintaining the fragile ecological balance of the region and the sustainable development of social economy. Based on the remote sensing images of Landsat TM, MSS and Landsat 8 OLI from 1997 to 2017, this paper studies the changes of glaciers in the region over the past 20 years by extracting information from the images. The research results show that the Kunlun Mountain glacier as a whole shows a phenomenon of shrinking glacier area. Based on the analysis of meteorological data, we infer that the changes in the Kunlun Mountain glacier area are mainly caused by the combined effects of average temperature and annual cumulative precipitation. The increase in precipitation from 1997 to 2007 led to an increase in the area of glaciers, while the area of glaciers from 2007 to 2016 increased. The reduction is related to the average temperature. © 2022 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128668558"

The development of wettable peatland products and services (termed ‘Paludiculture’) present significant opportunities for enabling a transition away from peat-harvesting (fossil fuels) to developing ‘green’ eco-innovations. However, this must be balanced with sustainable carbon sequestration and environmental protection. This complex transition from ‘brown to green’ must be met in real time by enabling digital technologies across the full value chain. This will potentially necessitate creation of new green-business models with the potential to support disruptive innovation. This timely paper describes digital transformation of paludiculture-based eco-innovation that will potentially lead to a paradigm shift towards using smart digital technologies to address efficiency of products and services along with future-proofing for climate change. Digital transform of paludiculture also aligns with the ‘Industry 5.0 - a human-centric solution’. However, companies supporting peatland innovation may lack necessary standards, data-sharing or capabilities that can also affect viable business model propositions that can jeopardize economic, political and social sustainability. Digital solutions may reduce costs, increase productivity, improve produce develop, and achieve faster time to market for paludiculture. Digitisation also enables information systems to be open, interoperable, and user-friendly. This constitutes the first study to describe the digital transformation of paludiculture, both vertically and horizontally, in order to inform sustainability that includes process automation via AI, machine learning, IoT-Cloud informed sensors and robotics, virtual and augmented reality, and blockchain for cyber-physical systems. Thus, the aim of this paper is to describe the applicability of digital transformation to actualize the benefits and opportunities of paludiculture activities and enterprises in the Irish midlands with a global orientation. © 2022 The Authors","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85131442104"

This change brings a question of how to reach enough natural products even in small areas. Vertical farming option emerged as one of the sustainable options with the short supply chain processes. Besides, it helps to decrease the effects of climate change and improve the sustainability since it utilizes less water and avoids problems such as arid soil, soil infertility etc. Technological developments started to spread rapidly in the agricultural field and led to various digital transformations according to the needs. Recently, the new concept of smart agriculture makes agriculture more efficient and effective thanks to high-precision algorithms. The most significant farming applications are irrigation management, pest and disease control, greenhouse condition monitoring, soil and water quality monitoring, precision agriculture and dairy management. In this study, machine learning methods are applied such as CNN image processing model which can detect and identifying diseases on plants. In this research, AI based lettuce diseases detection system is proposed. An AI model is developed to identify different lettuce diseases. The model was built with ResNet50 and ImageNet on Tensorflow. Various over fitting prevention methods are also applied to the model to compensate for the limited training dataset and the results of the study are discussed. It will guide people towards enhancing awareness of the importance and necessity of using various machine learning techniques and various alternatives to traditional agriculture for the sustainability. © 2022 Newswood Limited.

For a given climate change scenario (e.g., representative concentration pathway (RCP)), geographic location (longitude and latitude), site quality (site index) and crop plan (e.g., initial espacement density and subsequent thinning treatments), the resultant hierarchical-based SSDMM consisting of six integrated modules, enabled the prediction of a multitude of management-relevant performance metrics over rotational lengths out to the year 2100. These metrics included productivity measures (e.g., mean annual volume, biomass and carbon increments), volumetric yield estimates (e.g., total and merchantable volumes), pole and log product distributions (e.g., number and size distribution of pulp and saw logs, and utility poles), biomass production and carbon sequestration outcomes (e.g., oven-dried masses of above-ground components and associated carbon mass equivalents), recoverable end-product volumes and associated monetary values (e.g., volumes and economic worth estimates of recovered chip and dimensional lumber products ex-tractable via stud and randomized length mill processing protocols), and crop tree fibre attributes reflective of end-product potential (e.g., wood density, microfibril angle, and modulus of elasticity). The core modules responsible for quantifying stand dynamics and structural change were developed using 491 tree-list measurements and 146 stand-level summaries obtained from 98 remeasured permanent sample plots situated within 21 geographically separated plantation-based initial spacing and thinning experiments distributed throughout southern and north-central Ontario. Computationally, the red pine SSDMM and associated algorithmic analogue (1) produced mathematically compatible stem and end-product volume estimates, (2) accounted for density-dependent as well as density-independent mortality losses, response delay following thinning and genetic worth effects, (3) enabled end-users to specify merchantability standards (log and pole dimensions), product degrade factors and cost profiles, and (4) addressed climate change impacts on rotational yield outcomes by geo-referencing RCP-specific effects on stand dynamical processes via the deployment of a climate-driven biophysical site-based height-age model. In summary, the provision of the red pine SSDMM and its unique ability to account for locale-specific climate change effects on crop planning forecasts inclusive of utility pole production, should be of consequential utility as the complexities of silvicultural decision-making intensify during the Anthropocene. © 2022 by the author.

Currently, no universal indicators are available to identify the effect of extreme climate events on specific crops of nutritional and commercial importance, as they need to be developed according to each species’ physiology. Likewise, it is necessary to develop production qualifiers that allow us to identify whether the agricultural year presents high or low climatic hazards for a specific crop. In this study of roselle (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) grown in dryland agricultural conditions in the Bajo Balsas, Michoacán, Mexico, we aimed to 1) generate and validate climatic hazard indicators and 2) propose an equation to calculate annual climatic hazards, considering the different phenological crop stages.

Photovoltaic generators have strong relationship with solar irradiation and outdoor temperature in energy generation process. These meteorological parameters are volatile and uncertain in nature so, unexpected changes on these parameters produce variations on solar photovoltaic generators’ output power. While many researchers have been focused in recent years on the development of novel models for forecasting involved meteorological parameters in photovoltaic generation, they commonly do not consider an analysis step of the data before using it in the developed models.

Global climate change and anthropogenic impacts on surface water resources have led to increased competing claims on groundwater resources to meet an exponential water demand for environmental needs, agricultural and developmental needs. This has led to the unsustainable exploitation of groundwater resources, resulting in groundwater table declines, threatening the sustainability of TGDV. It is on this premise that the review aims to provide a detailed overview on the progress in remote sensing of TGDV. More specifically, the paper provides a background on TGDV and threats, and then further explores recent knowledge on vegetation response to groundwater variability and climate change impacts on TGDV. This review also focuses on recent progress in remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS) based techniques for mapping and monitoring of TGDV and explores the available satellite products and delineation techniques. Finally, the challenges of remote sensing and future research direction are explored. To date, research on TGDV has gained considerable interest with the year 2020 resulting in the most scientific journal publications. Of significant importance is an increase in studies integrating field measurements, model-based techniques with remotely sensed estimates. Despite this progress, only 0.06% of groundwater dependent ecosystems (GDE) research has utilized remote sensing techniques in the past 20 years, with the top three publishing countries namely, Australia, USA, and China. The literature reveals that TDGV are highly heterogenous, complex ecosystems with unique responses to varying groundwater levels. The vegetation responses differ with the landscape, vegetation type, and seasonality at specific groundwater table thresholds. Despite significant progress in TGDV scientific research, further remote sensing studies are required to understand the annual and inter-annual vegetation response to groundwater variability at local scales. Further, climate impacts are difficult to discriminate from other influences such as disturbances, management, and anthropogenic activities. Moreover, new generation remote sensing products integrated with machine learning techniques have the potential to improve TGDV delineation. Despite these challenges, the development of cloud computing technologies such as google earth engine (GEE) and artificial intelligence (AI) provide advanced computer-processing capabilities for long-term monitoring and integration of multi-source datasets required to capture the effects of climate and groundwater variability on TGDV. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85110888672"

Degradation of the natural environment and the climate crisis are exceedingly complex phenomena requiring the most advanced and innovative solutions. Aiming to spur groundbreaking research and practical solutions of AI for environmental sustainability, we argue that AI can support the derivation of culturally appropriate organizational processes and individual practices to reduce the natural resource and energy intensity of human activities. The true value of AI will not be in how it enables society to reduce its energy, water, and land use intensities, but rather, at a higher level, how it facilitates and fosters environmental governance. A comprehensive review of the literature indicates that research regarding AI for sustainability is challenged by (1) overreliance on historical data in machine learning models, (2) uncertain human behavioral responses to AI-based interventions, (3) increased cybersecurity risks, (4) adverse impacts of AI applications, and (5) difficulties in measuring effects of intervention strategies. The review indicates that future studies of AI for sustainability should incorporate (1) multilevel views, (2) systems dynamics approaches, (3) design thinking, (4) psychological and sociological considerations, and (5) economic value considerations to show how AI can deliver immediate solutions without introducing long-term threats to environmental sustainability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85083357298"

The effective management of urban water drainage systems is particularly relevant to control and regulate the runoff impacts. Nevertheless, the mitigation of climate change effects and the adaptation to its impacts call for the implementation of new sustainable strategies and solutions. In this context, a key role can be played by Low Impact Development (LID) technologies of Best Management Practices (BMPs). Such innovative design approaches can lead to more sustainable and effective strategies for urban runoff control. In this paper, a methodology to increase the urban resilience to flooding risk through LID-BMPs is proposed and discussed. A tool for the optimal selection and design of different LID-BMPs is presented. The tool couples GIS processing with hydraulic simulations, constituting a Decision Support System (DSS) based on the meta-heuristic optimization algorithm Harmony Search (HS). The methodology was tested on the case study site of Soccavo, a suburban area in the Municipality of Naples (Italy). Several LID measures, including bio-retention systems, porous pavements, green roofs, were considered. Then, the effectiveness of combining LIDs with grey solutions to carry out hybrid solutions was also assessed. Results showed the capability of the proposed approach in detecting technically and economically viable solutions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138172693"

These models have had a major impact on context learning from text in many fields, e.g., health care, finance, manufacturing; however, there have been no empirical advances to date in electric mobility. Given the digital transformations in energy and transportation, there are growing opportunities for real-time analysis of critical energy infrastructure. A large, untapped source of EV mobility data is unstructured text generated by mobile app users reviewing charging stations. Using transformer-based deep learning, we present multilabel classification of charging station reviews with performance exceeding human experts in some cases. This paves the way for automatic discovery and real-time tracking of EV user experiences, which can inform local and regional policies to address climate change. © 2020 The Authors; The transportation sector is a major contributor to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and is a driver of adverse health effects globally. Increasingly, government policies have promoted the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) as a solution to mitigate GHG emissions. However, government analysts have failed to fully utilize consumer data in decisions related to charging infrastructure. This is because a large share of EV data is unstructured text, which presents challenges for data discovery. In this article, we deploy advances in transformer-based deep learning to discover topics of attention in a nationally representative sample of user reviews. We report classification accuracies greater than 91% (F1 scores of 0.83), outperforming previously leading algorithms in this domain.

The threat of worldwide pandemics led to the development of prevention and mitigation strategies implemented via public policies and national/international legal instruments. These measures involve networks of organisations engaged in a wide range of quite disparate activities. We present two methods to evaluate the collaborative potential of a network of 16 organisations and identify measures to promote their coordination: 1) the first method uses Galois lattices to identify groups of organisations and issues forming a nexus able to tackle with the environment and health challenges. It also allows pointing out the divide between some sub-issues that should be considered together in order to develop an integrated approach of these problems as recommended for example by the One Health initiative; 2) the second method, inspired by the functioning of networks of cerebral cortex areas for the realisation of high-level cognitive functions, analyses the graphs induced by mutual information functions between organisations. Here we evaluate these functions based on the composition of the governing boards (altogether involving 91 organisations) and partnerships (altogether involving 263 organisations) of these organisations. The approach gives the opportunity to assess a priori the effects induced by a change in the profile of the collaborating organisations. The contributions of these two methods are then discussed and compared to other approaches developed for the analysis of social intelligence or socio-cognitive artificial systems. Both methods are illustrated by the analysis of a network of several organisations involved in the management of health and environmental issues in Southeast Asia (hot spot for emerging infectious diseases and for biodiversity). Taken as a whole, our findings show that regional governance in the health-environment sector is polycentric and entangled, and provide guidance for improving governance on the basis of the competences and collaborations of participating organisations. © 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85034980647"

An environment-driven design technique is introduced and tested at the urban and architectural scale. Utilizing the interplay between the architectural intention and weather influences (specifically solar radiation and wind effects), the optimal design solution for the urban configuration and architectural shape emerges. An exploratory case study near the amphitheater in Kosice, Slovakia, demonstrates the proposed approach. Through the real-time iterative analysis of the environmental performance of multiple design variants, an urban concept of offices/apartment blocks, reacting to the local wind and sun situation, is formed. The wind flow situation and comfort are investigated in a design loop, blending the newly developed AI-driven simulation prediction models of InFraRed1 and the sun hours analysis in Ladybug with the Galapagos optimization within Grasshopper. The final step of this method is the design and subsequent wind and sun analysis of fluid-shaped lamellae in three variants acting as wind catchers/shading systems. Improved pedestrian wind comfort for outdoor sitting (more than 30% increase in areas suitable for short and prolonged sitting) and optimum sunlight hours (25% gain in sunlight during winter solstice) is achieved using the proposed technique. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139867315"

However, most actions only try to assuage the impacts of climate change without improving the resource flows generated by human activities. In this paper, we propose a semi-quantitative assessment of the impacts of biowaste-based energy transition by engaging all relevant social stakeholders' evaluation in the strategic plan. This holistic approach models a Decision Support System (DSS) to effectively evaluate the interplay of local and sectoral low-carbon actions. Regional energy alliances and stakeholders are used for participatory modeling to promote the buildup of the learning base of this DSS. The core pillar of the DSS involves the application of advanced features of soft computing for the development of a Fuzzy Cognitive Map (FCM) that elicits the inter-causalities of the critical factors affecting the energy transitions towards bio-economy options. The concepts participating in the map are established by experts, and their interrelations via a learning process that utilizes survey statistics. The strands of research include scenarios to highlight the effect of energy provision to urbanization and the increase of urban actors (social, technological, political) in influencing the decision making related to low-carbon policies. Particularly, we study a use case of a Greek region that, despite its munificent agricultural production, also disclosures a stimulated manufacturing economy sector.

The results show that temperature, housing units, and solar PV systems have the highest influence on net electric load.

We aimed to address this subject by studying the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of malaria and the effect of climate change on malaria transmission over 27 years in Hainan, an island province in China. Methods: For this longitudinal cohort study, we used a decades-long dataset of malaria incidence reports from Hainan, China, to investigate the pattern of malaria transmission in Hainan relative to temperature and the incidence at increasing altitudes. Climatic data were obtained from the local meteorological stations in Hainan during 1984–2010 and the WorldClim dataset. A temperature-dependent R0 model and negative binomial generalised linear model were used to decipher the relationship between climate factors and malaria incidence in the tropical region. Findings: Over the past few decades, the annual peak incidence has appeared earlier in the central highland regions but later in low-altitude regions in Hainan, China. Results from the temperature-dependent model showed that these long-term changes of incidence peak timing are linked to rising temperatures (of about 1·5°C). Further, a 1°C increase corresponds to a change in cases of malaria from –5·6% (95% CI –4·5 to –6·6) to –9·2% (95% CI –7·6 to –10·9) from the northern plain regions to the central highland regions during the rainy season. In the dry season, the change in cases would be 4·6% (95% CI 3·7 to 5·5) to 11·9% (95% CI 9·8 to 14·2) from low-altitude areas to high-altitude areas. Interpretation: Our study empirically supports the idea that increasing temperatures can generate opposing effects on malaria dynamics for lowland and highland regions. This should be further investigated and incorporated into future modelling, disease burden calculations, and malaria control, with attention for central highland regions under climate change.

However, the impact of spatial soil variability along with climatic factors on crop yield remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of soil and climatic variability on maize yield. We used Alabama as a case study because the agriculture is predominantly rainfed and there is a large variability in growing season precipitation due to the influence of climate variability signals such as the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The cropping system model CERES-Maize of the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate growth, development, and grain yield for maize for the top ten maize-producing counties in Alabama under rainfed conditions during dry and wet ENSO years. Maize yield simulations were compared for one prominent agricultural soil in each county, the top three prominent agricultural soils in each county, and spatially distributed SSURGO soils in each county. Simulated yields were then compared with maize yields reported by the National Agricultural Statistical Services (NASS). The simulation results showed that maize yield was impacted by both climate variability and spatial soil variability.

Thus, the need for regular monitoring of coastal water quality is becoming increasingly vital, and remote sensing is deemed to be a viable approach particularly due to its cost-effectiveness. Over the past two decades, remote sensing using satellite imaging has already been adopted in various tasks related to the monitoring of coastal hydro-enviro nment, including the detection of oil spills, identification of turbid plumes, mapping of marine ecosystems, etc. Despite their usefulness, space-borne sensors are subjected to constraints such as low spatial resolution, clouds and atmospheric interference, sparse frequency, and inflexible scheduling. Recently, remote sensing with portable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (pUAVs) is emerging as a promising alternative for high spatial-resolution monitoring of coastal hydro-environment, with the key advantages that they can minimize the effects of atmospheric disruptions and be implemented with a frequent schedule to perform on-demand monitoring. In addition, with the technological advances in the sensor's design, UAVs are now capable of capturing data with fine spectral resolutions, ranging from several (multispectral) to hundreds (hyperspectral) of spectral bands. Data analytic is also improving rapidly with the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the recent developments in the utilization of UAV-based remote sensing for the sustainable development of the coastal hydro-environment, particularly with pUAVs. The key technical issues, including the design of UAV systems and the processing of data, are examined for specific applications. Future prospects for implementation are also discussed. © 2021","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105820254"

Development of robust management and suppression plans requires accurate estimates of future burn probabilities. This study describes the development and validation of two hybrid intelligence predictive models that rely on an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and two metaheuristic optimization algorithms, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA) and firefly algorithm (FA), for the spatially explicit prediction of wildfire probabilities. A suite of ten explanatory variables (altitude, slope, aspect, land use, rainfall, soil order, temperature, wind effect, and distance to roads and human settlements) was investigated and a spatial database constructed using 32 fire events from the Zagros ecoregion (Iran). The frequency ratio model was used to assign weights to each class of variables that depended on the strength of the spatial association between each class and the probability of wildfire occurrence. The weights were then used for training the ANFIS-GA and ANFIS-FA hybrid models. The models were validated using the ROC-AUC method that indicated that the ANFIS-GA model performed better (AUCsuccess rate = 0.92; AUCprediction rate = 0.91) than the ANFIS-FA model (AUCsuccess rate = 0.89; AUCprediction rate = 0.88). The efficiency of these models was compared to a single ANFIS model and statistical analyses of paired comparisons revealed that the two meta-optimized predictive models significantly improved wildfire prediction accuracy compared to the single ANFIS model (AUCsuccess rate = 0.82; AUCprediction rate = 0.78). We concluded that such predictive models may become valuable toolkits to effectively guide fire management plans and on-the-ground decisions on firefighting strategies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85065673213"

Historically, each component in urban water development evolved over time with different objectives for “different” types of water. Even today, the trend continues, as different urban water services are managed in silos. This trend is less sustainable, resilient, and reliable, mainly because of significant pressures on freshwater supplies exerted by the increasing population, demand for high living standards, rapid urbanization, and climate change. To cope with these challenges, the conventional thinking needs to change. This paper identifies a number of significant research gaps related to inter-relationships among various UWS service components. An innovative paradigm, the “one water” approach (OWA), which considers “urban water” as a single entity, is investigated herein. Currently, Australia, the USA, and Singapore are leading the implementation of the OWA, whereas only a few Canadian municipalities have embraced OWA at a very basic level. Among the EU nations, the Netherlands have emphasized the need for integrated water resource management in an urban environment. This review highlights the challenges in adopting the OWA, and also proposes guiding principles in ongoing water management practices. Institutional complexities involving an intricate regulatory structure for different UWS service components, a wider fragmentation in decision making at government levels, and insufficient stakeholder engagement within and between water utilities and other institutions present serious challenges. Various strategies such as, data sharing between water utilities, use of novel technologies (e.g., artificial intelligence, sensor technologies), and visionary leadership at different government levels have been identified as key drivers for the adoption and implementation of the OWA. The authors believe that a paradigm shift from “conventional” approach to OWA is needed to increase resiliency and reliability of water services and assist decision-makers of UWSs. © 2021 The Author(s).","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126591139"

This results from the widespread effects of climate change and of competition from other sectors for water, and increasing societal pressure to reduce nutrient contamination of water bodies. The widespread and growing adoption of drip irrigation and fertigation provides vegetable growers with the technical infrastructure for greatly improved irrigation and nutrient management. However, quantitative decisions to achieve optimal irrigation and nutrient management, and increasingly of the two together, require complex decision-making. Numerous factors regarding climate, soil characteristics, field infrastructure, and crop characteristics need to be considered. Decision Support Systems (DSSs) and simulation models are tools that process large and diverse amounts of information to provide irrigation and nutrient recommendations that are specific to individual crops and sites. Commonly, DSSs incorporate simulation models, which enables site and crop specific assessment, and the possibility for dynamic responses to fluctuations in climate etc. There is an on-going trend for web-based DSSs that can access on-line data bases such as of climate and soil data, and that users consult with smartphone Apps. This article firstly reviews several general aspects regarding the use of DSSs/models in commercial vegetable production, such as how to enhance their user-friendliness. Subsequently, it describes DSSs/models that have been developed or are being used to assist with irrigation or nutrient management, or both, of vegetable crops. The most relevant aspects of these DSSs/models are highlighted. In addition to DSSs/models for practical on-farm management, the use of DSSs/models for scenario analysis to demonstrate theoretical case studies to policy makers, growers and advisors is discussed. A focus throughout is on how to make these products attractive and effective to potential users. The geographical focus is on Europe; however, particularly relevant cases from elsewhere are also considered. With the current state of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), and considering the inevitable future developments, DSSs can provide vegetable growers with effective and user-friendly tools to assist them to optimize irrigation and nutrient management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85085749580"

Despite the attempts of developing disparate approaches and concepts at different scales of economies, the global issues are still worsening. As a consequence, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has introduced the concept of Design for Sustainability (DfS) to evaluate the sustainability aspects of product designs, acknowledging the importance of developing sustainable products (and services). Even though the DfS approach has been recognised as an appropriate base to establish a sustainable global economy, the scope of the assessment still requires further research, specifically with the social impacts assessment. Hence, in this study, we propose a multi-criteria decision support system based on the DfS principles, including an exhaustive set of criteria referred in the Social Life Cycle Assessment framework for the purpose of evaluating three chosen sanitation system designs. We applied the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process to solve the proposed model. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to understand the effects of the chosen priority weights. The analysis shows that the sanitation system design choice is heavily influenced depending on whether the high importance the packaging and logistics phase or the usage phase, emphasising the need for a comprehensive life-cycle analysis. The research reported in this paper is a step toward realising the targets of DfS at a practice level by simultaneously building on the original proposals and using them to solve real word design selection problems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85018370571"

In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. Chapter 2: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander connection to culture: building stronger individual and collective wellbeing: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said — that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Chapter 3: Physical determinants of health: healthy, liveable and sustainable communities: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners — to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. Chapter 4: Health promotion in the Anthropocene: the ecological determinants of health: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia’s position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches — planetary health, Indigenous people’s knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. Chapter 5: Disrupting the commercial determinants of health: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. Chapter 6: Digital determinants of health: the digital transformation: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. Chapter 7: Governance for health and equity: a vision for our future: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia’s direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing — most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media. Measures to overcome the climate crisis were adopted and democratic processes introduced in the provision of housing, education and community development. © 2021 AMPCo Pty Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85105030886"

Productivity of many crop species is impaired by abiotic stress such as heat, salinity, drought, cold and heavy metal stresses. In groundnut, the impact of high temperatures and drought on crop growth and development have been extensively studied. In order to meet global food and nutritional welfare, there is a need to consider the physiological responses and molecular pathways underlying abiotic stress tolerance. Several traits like water use efficiency (WUE), chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, root traits and yield-related parameters were found to be affected by abiotic stresses in groundnut. The availability of germplasm resources and genomic technologies help in exploring the tolerant genotypes conferring abiotic stress tolerance. The genomic regions associated with the tolerance related traits were studied using genetic linkage and association-based approaches using different types of molecular markers in groundnut. Latest advances in sequencing and artificial intelligence-based gene prediction have improved the process of identifying possible genes that impart abiotic stress tolerance. The transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and genetic engineering approaches were utilized for imparting drought tolerance. Though genomics studies related to heat, salinity, cold tolerance are very limited in groundnut, there is high potential to utilize available resources and multi-omics technologies to improve groundnut for abiotic stress tolerance. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137987653"

Most standards are prescriptive, defining cements by composition of SCMs, hence the number of types increase, and composition limits widen. Cements are classified by compressive strength of fixed water/cement mortars. This pragmatic approach ignores physical effects, that results in variable mixing water demand. It hinders the development of cements with low water demand, products of optimized particle engineering and dispersants, which allows formulate cements with lower clinker fraction. Also, most standard tests are difficult to automate to generate large datasets crucial to train artificial intelligence. Performance-based standards are an alternative, but simple and progressive approach is recommended to ease transition. Cement types should not be solely defined by composition but rather classified by performance characteristics including durability and environmental. Combined water fraction, cwf, may be a good parameter to replace strength class. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85070679525"

El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is one of the most important inter-annual climate signals in the tropics and has a global impact on atmospheric circulation and precipitation. To address the impact of climate change, accurate ENSO forecasts can help prevent related climate disasters. Traditional prediction methods mainly include statistical methods and dynamic methods. However, due to the variability and diversity of the temporal and spatial evolution of ENSO, traditional methods still have great uncertainty in predicting ENSO. In recent years, with the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology, it has gradually penetrated into all aspects of people’s lives, and the climate field has also benefited. For example, deep learning methods in artificial intelligence can automatically learn and train from a large amount of sample data, obtain excellent feature representation, and effectively improve the performance of various learning tasks. It is widely used in computer vision, natural language processing, and other fields. In 2019, Ham et al. used a convolutional neural network (CNN) model in ENSO forecasting 18 months in advance, and the winter ENSO forecasting skill could reach 0.64, far exceeding the dynamic model with a forecasting skill of 0.5. The research results were regarded as the pioneering work of deep learning in the field of weather forecasting. This paper introduces the traditional ENSO forecasting methods and focuses on summarizing the various latest artificial intelligence methods and their forecasting effects for ENSO forecasting, so as to provide useful reference for future research by researchers. © 2022 by the authors.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140777212"

Given this, based on the fact that China’s industrial manufacturing is more intelligent, this paper uses industrial sector data and robot data from 2000 to 2017 to examine the impact of intelligent manufacturing on industrial carbon dioxide emissions and to discuss its internal mechanism. The research found that intelligent manufacturing significantly inhibits carbon dioxide emissions in the industrial sectors. The emission reduction effect is more obvious in industries with higher carbon emissions and intelligence. The mechanism test shows that intelligent manufacturing mainly achieves industrial emission reduction by reducing fossil energy consumption in the production process and improving energy use efficiency. The research findings of this paper provide favorable evidence for using new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, to achieve carbon emissions reduction, and validate the importance of intelligent manufacturing in tackling climate change in the future.

Before the 1970s, various businesses and economics could affect and improve technologies, and humans' life. Since we reached the 70ies, and with the beginning of the 3rd wave or the post-industrial era, the new modern technologies such as Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Business (IoB), Internet of Energy (IoE), Internet of Manufacturing (IoM), Internet of Health (IoH), the emerging digitization, and innovative smartness in addition, issues such as know-how, do-how, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and others could influence businesses, the economy, urban infrastructures, societies, social impacts and even human life. Wars, sanctions, sciences, technologies, IT, IoT, and smartness work together and have impacts on each other's, businesses, economy, and human life. Fundamentally, during humans' history inventions and innovations have been created through restrictions and challenges. Wars, sanctions, low sustainability, risks of contagion, recessions, climate pollution, environmental change, biodiversity collapse, urban sprawl, growing urbanizations, lack of infrastructure, gentrification, economic instabilities, and recently health crises are introduced as main restrictions. Wars and welfare integrate with human's life desirably or undesirably and make innovation. Improvement through such innovative digital technologies are so admirable because most of them have changed the world. Sustainability has an important role for societies and urbans to improve their quality of livability and life. The world academic economy has changed from an academic SocioEdu economy to a data and innovative academic SocioEdu, ecosystem and economy, leading to the concept of the ""Internet of Business-Education"". with many popular IoT applications involved (i.e. wearables, smart city, smart society, smart healthcare, smart welfare, smart SMEs, smart retail, smart supply chain).

On the basis of the developed procedure, a smooth assessment of the current values of the controlled parameters and compensation control adequate to disturbing influences are provided. The developed technology is designed to provide an increase in the quality indicators of overcoming transient processes, and, consequently, to improve the efficiency of controlling the climate dynamic system during the implementation of the production process for manufacturing electronics with increased requirements for its operational characteristics. Modern information systems are characterized by the rapid development of the capabilities of the used hardware. At the same time, in order to achieve maximum results, the use of artificial intelligence technologies is inevitable, the most effective implementation of which requires adequate consideration of all available information about the controlled production process. In the formulation under consideration, the complexity of the problem is determined by the need to meet mutually conflicting requirements while ensuring specified values of climatic parameters. The specificity of the control problem is determined by the fact that a change (restoration) of the values of one controlled parameter should not lead to a loss of the set values of other climatic parameters.

In this context, the application of simulation models is useful to duel with the uncertainty and complexity of water system by providing stakeholders with the best solution. This paper outlines an integrated management planning network is developed based on Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) to evaluate current and future water management system of Langat River Basin, Malaysia under various scenarios. The WEAP model is known as an integrated decision support system investigate major stresses on demand and supply in terms of water availability in catchment scale. In fact, WEAP is applicable to simulate complex systems including various sectors within a single catchment or transboundary river system. To construct the model, by taking account of the Langat catchment and the corresponding demand points, we defined the hydrological model into 10 sub-hydrological catchments and 17 demand points included the export of treated water to the major cities outside the catchment. The model is calibrated and verified by several quantitative statistics (coefficient of determination, R2; Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE and Percent bias, PBIAS). The trend of supply and demand in the catchment is evaluated under three scenarios to 2050, 1: Population growth rate, 2: Demand side management (DSM) and 3: Combination of DSM and reduce non-revenue water (NRW). Results show that by reducing NRW and proper DSM, unmet demand able to reduce significantly. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023189288"

Consequently, there is an increasing trend for minimizing or replacing traditional fossil fuel-based economies with a more sustainable, carbon-negative (or neutral) alternative. Microalgae-based systems have been considered for decades as a clean technology for carbon mitigation where the sequestered CO2 is converted to valuable biomass products with several biotechnology applications. This chapter reviews the advancements made in bioreactor design to offer superior CO2 diffusion and mass transfer as well as the use of synthetic biology for the development of newer engineered strains with much improved capacity to assimilate CO2. With the rising level of technology complexity involved in these modern systems, the use of artificial intelligence is likely to play major roles in decision-making helping us to rapidly foster systems operating anomalies with real-time corrective actions.

Thus, assessing agricultural suitability and yield reduction under climate change is crucial for sustainable agricultural production. In this study, we used two sub-models of the agro-ecological decision support system MicroLEIS (Terraza and Cervatana) to evaluate the impacts of climate change on land capability and yield reduction or wheat and sunflower as major rainfed crops in different Mediterranean soil types (in Andalucia, Southern Spain). The Terraza sub-model provides an experimental prediction for the bioclimate deficiency and yield reduction, while the Cervatana sub-model predicts the general land use suitability for specific agricultural uses. Sixty-two districts in Southern Spain were modeled and mapped using soil data and the A1B climate scenario (balanced scenario) for three 30-year periods ending in 2040, 2070 and 2100, respectively. Our results showed that the majority of agricultural soils were suitable for wheat production, and less for sunflowers, especially under projected climate change scenarios. Extreme impacts of climate change were observed in the soil types Typic Xerofluvents and Calcic Haploxerepts, where the land capability was reduced from Good and Moderate classes to the Marginal class. This was especially observed in sunflower crops by 2100. Yield reduction of sunflower was much higher than the reduction for wheat, especially under the projected climate periods, where the results for 2100 showed the severest effect on crop yields with about 95% of the sunflower area showing yield reductions. This high variability of the evaluation results demonstrates the importance of using soil factors, climate and crop information in conjunction in decision-making regarding the formulation of site-specific soil use and management strategies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084939527"

In most of the countries where the expansion of cropland is merely impossible, agriculture automation has become the only option and is the need of the hour. Internet of things and Artificial intelligence have already started capitalizing across all the industries including agriculture. Advancement in these digital technologies has made revolutionary changes in agriculture by providing smart systems that can monitor, control, and visualize various farm operations in real-time and with comparable intelligence of human experts. The potential applications of IoT and AI in the development of smart farm machinery, irrigation systems, weed and pest control, fertilizer application, greenhouse cultivation, storage structures, drones for plant protection, crop health monitoring, etc. are discussed in the paper. The main objective of the paper is to provide an overview of recent research in the area of digital technology-driven agriculture and identification of the most prominent applications in the field of agriculture engineering using artificial intelligence and internet of things. The research work done in the areas during the last 10 years has been reviewed from the scientific databases including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. It has been observed that the digitization of agriculture using AI and IoT has matured from their nascent conceptual stage and reached the execution phase. The technical details of artificial intelligence, IoT, and challenges related to the adoption of these digital technologies are also discussed.

Refrigerants have an important contribution to the aforementioned environmental impact. In particular, hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) contribute to the destruction of the ozone layer and the increase of the greenhouse effect. Protocols, international agreements, and legislation were developed to slow down the emission of greenhouse gases. Prohibition and definition of deadlines for the gradual elimination of various refrigerants have been proposed to replace them with others that are environmentally sustainable. Soon, the refrigeration sector will have to replace some refrigerants with others that are alternative and/or sustainable with minimal or zero environmental impact. A computational tool to support decision-making regarding the selection of alternative and/or sustainable refrigerant to replace the old one is developed to be used by refrigeration companies, manufacturers, and installers. A suggestion of refrigerants with reduced environmental impact is provided, ensuring similar thermal performance and energy efficiency, considering the safety level and renovation cost of the installation and refrigerant itself. This decision support system (DSS) uses an objective function that includes the technical specifications and properties of alternative and sustainable refrigerants. The computational tool is applied in the agri-food sector in three case studies. The results show not only the consistency of the computational tool, but also its flexibility, objectivity, and simplicity. Its use allows companies to choose refrigerants with reduced environmental impact, reduced or zero ozone depletion potential and global warming impact, thus contributing to environmental sustainability. © 2022 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142636496"

Three land use changes scenarios were identified and analysed, namely: the current situation, energy crop cultivation in marginal lands, and the possible abandonment of lands such as these. Energy crop cultivation in marginal lands is widely considered to be a useful opportunity for farmers, against the progressive risk of under-utilization or abandonment; nevertheless, the large areas needed can cause important environmental side-effects. In order to assess the possible variations in environmental components in the ex-ante planning phase, scenarios were assessed in terms of habitat and biodiversity ecosystems services (using both monetary and indexes approach), focusing also on possible environmental fragmentation analysis by means of landscape metrics, which are simple measures used to deepen landscape configuration and structure. The S-MCDA process allowed about 10% of the study area with less favourable environmental conditions to be defined, where land use change is desirable in a medium-short time frame. For the energy crops scenario, the ecosystem services (ESs) approach highlights positive repercussions in terms of habitat quality and biodiversity value. Similar trends are highlighted by different ESs assessment methods adopted (monetary and indexes), confirming themselves. Also, landscape pattern analysis confirmed positive habitat connectivity trends: the delineation of fringe areas has preserved, in energy crops scenario, natural and semi-natural classes, reducing the risk of disturbance with respect to the biodiversity and habitat. This condition assumes that adopted S-MCDA method can contribute positively and significantly to the definition of LUC scenarios and land management. In conclusion, marginal lands can become an opportunity to improve socio-economic conditions and to enhance land image, while respecting the environment. LUC scenarios building, and their assessment by means of ecological indicators become a dynamic and structured tool in the land use planning /management process to support decision maker choices and to re-calibrate interventions, with the aim of contributing to sustainable policies of land management (ecological corridors, compensation and / or mitigation measures, etc.), emphasizing land sustainable management benefits (such as climate change adaptation or disaster risk reduction). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85079386512"

To effectively deal with this increased risk requires the development of validated tools to identify coastal areas of higher risk and to evaluate the effectiveness of disaster risk reduction (DRR) measures. This paper analyses the performance in the application of two tools which have been developed in the RISC-KIT project: the regional Coastal Risk Assessment Framework (CRAF) and a hotspot early warning system coupled with a decision support system (EWS/DSS). The paper discusses the main achievements of the tools as well as improvements needed to support their further use by the coastal community. The CRAF, a tool to identify and rank hotspots of coastal risk at the regional scale, provides useful results for coastal managers and stakeholders. A change over time of the hotspots location and ranking can be analysed as a function of changes on coastal occupation or climate change. This tool is highly dependent on the quality of available information and a major constraint to its application is the relatively poor availability and accessibility of high-quality data, particularly in respect to social-economic indicators, and to lesser extent the physical environment. The EWS/DSS can be used as a warning system to predict potential impacts or to test the effectiveness of risk reduction measures at a given hotspot. This tool provides high resolution results, but needs validation against impact data, which are still scarce. The EWS/DSS tool can be improved by enhancing the vulnerability relationships and detailing the receptors in each area (increasing the detail, but also model simulations). The developed EWS/DSS can be adapted and extended to include a greater range of conditions (including climate change), receptors, hazards and impacts, enhancing disaster preparedness for effective risk reduction for further events or morphological conditions. Despite these concerns, the tools assessed in this paper proved to be valuable instruments for coastal management and risk reduction that can be adopted in a wide range of coastal areas. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85033459945"

Furthermore, the conventional transportation system also emits other particulate matter into the atmosphere that causes air pollution and associated health issues. Thus, the aforementioned negative consequences of fossil-based transport system make it central to the energy and climate challenge. Therefore, the most practical and sustainable solution for effective mitigation of climate change and energy security concerns is the electrification of the transportation sector – a paradigm shift in the conventional mobility sector. As the electric power system is already in transition and experiencing its own paradigm shift – Smart(er) Grid – “Transportation Electrification” is thus the timely development for introducing a paradigm shift in the mobility sector. The vision of electrified mobility is to lower the environmental footprint of the transportation sector, which further demands the utilization of more renewable energy resource-based generation mix in the electricity grid – “Greener Grid.” Thus, in this chapter, we explain the potential of transportation electrification for reducing the harmful climatic emissions and the nexus of energy and economy with electric mobility. The contrasting narrative of direct and indirect electrification with structural changes is further discussed with implications on cross-sectoral balance. We then provide an overview of the V2X horizon which includes vehicle-to-grid, vehicle-to-home, and building technology concepts. Moreover, we also investigate the concept of “smart vehicles” with the incorporation of “Artificial Intelligence” and some key enabling yet transdisciplinary technologies. Lastly, we present innovative alternative solutions for fueling the vehicles and the main trends, challenges, and future research directions in electric mobility transformation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

Background and Objectives: Forests and forestry have been confirmed to be sensitive to climate. On the other hand, human efforts to mitigate climate change influence forests and forest management. To facilitate the evaluation of future sustainability of forest management, decision support systems are applied. Our aims are to: (1) Adopt and validate decision support tool to incorporate climate change and its mitigation impacts on forest growth, global timber demands and prices for simulating future trends of forest ecosystem services in Lithuania, (2) determine the magnitude and spatial patterns of climate change effects on Lithuanian forests and forest management in the future, supposing that current forestry practices are continued. Materials and Methods: Upgraded version of Lithuanian forestry simulator Kupolis was used to model the development of all forests in the country until 2120 under management conditions of three climate change scenarios. Selected stand-level forest and forest management characteristics were aggregated to the level of regional branches of the State Forest Enterprise and analyzed for the spatial and temporal patterns of climate change effects. Results: Increased forest growth under a warmer future climate resulted in larger tree dimensions, volumes of growing stock, naturally dying trees, harvested assortments, and also higher profits from forestry activities. Negative impacts were detected for the share of broadleaved tree species in the standing volume and the tree species diversity. Climate change effects resulted in spatially clustered patterns-increasing stand productivity, and amounts of harvested timber were concentrated in the regions with dominating coniferous species, while the same areas were exposed to negative dynamics of biodiversity-related forest attributes. Current forest characteristics explained 70% or more of the variance of climate change effects on key forest and forest management attributes. Conclusions: Using forest decision support systems, climate change scenarios and considering the balance of delivered ecosystem services is suggested as a methodological framework for validating forest management alternatives aiming for more adaptiveness in Lithuanian forestry. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85072526944"

Using output of ten coupled models inter comparison project phase 5 (CMIP5) under two representative concentration pathway scenarios (RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5), the results indicated an increasing the annual mean temperature (1.64–1.84 °C under RCP 4.5, and 1.85–2.1 °C under RCP 8.5), reducing the amount of runoff into the reservoir (17.83–46.24% under RCP 4.5, and 21.54–50.91%under RCP 8.5), as well as increasing the amount of agricultural water requirement. Also, the results showed decreasing in reliability of system (12–53% under RCP 4.5, and 23–63% under RCP 8.5). Following, due to the main purpose of the system, six adaptation scenarios by using a questionnaire and stakeholders’ opinions are proposed to mitigate the effects of climate change.

The aim of this study is to review urban interventions and adopting digital technologies and AI-based algorithms to improve population health. A scoping review of the literature was conducted by querying MEDLINE, Web of Science, and Scopus databases. The included studies were categorized into one urban health area, suggested by the WHO, according to the type of intervention investigated. Out of 3733 records screened, 12 papers met all inclusion criteria. Four studies investigated the “outdoor and indoor pollution” area, one “climate change”, one “housing”, two “health and social services” and four “urban transport” areas. Only one article used a comprehensive approach to public health, investigating the use of AI and digital technologies both to characterize exposure conditions to health determinants and to monitor population health effects, while the others were limited to characterizing exposure conditions to health determinants, thus employing a preliminary public health perspective. From this point of view, countries should foster synergy for the development of research on digital technologies to address the determinants of health in the urban context. From a global health perspective, sharing results with the scientific community would also allow other countries to use those technologies that have been shown to be effective, paving the way for more sustainable living conditions worldwide. © 2022 by the authors.

We study a version of this problem that arises in the field of landscape genetics, where genetic similarity between organisms living in a heterogeneous landscape is explained by a weighted graph that encodes the ease of dispersal through that landscape. Our main contribution is an efficient algorithm for inverse landscape genetics, which is the task of inferring this graph from measurements of genetic similarity at different locations (graph nodes). Inverse landscape genetics is important in discovering impediments to species dispersal that threaten biodiversity and long-term species survival. In particular, it is widely used to study the effects of climate change and human development. Drawing on influential work that models organism dispersal using graph effective resistances (McRae 2006), we reduce the inverse landscape genetics problem to that of inferring graph edges from noisy measurements of these resistances, which can be obtained from genetic similarity data. Building on the NeurIPS 2018 work of Hoskins et al. (2018) on learning edges in social networks, we develop an efficient first-order optimization method for solving this problem. Despite its non-convex nature, experiments on synthetic and real genetic data establish that our method provides fast and reliable convergence, significantly outperforming existing heuristics used in the field. By providing researchers with a powerful, general purpose algorithmic tool, we hope our work will have a positive impact on accelerating work on landscape genetics. © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The threat of worldwide pandemics led to the development of prevention and mitigation strategies implemented via public policies and national/international legal instruments. These measures involve networks of organisations engaged in a wide range of quite disparate activities. We present two methods to evaluate the collaborative potential of a network of 16 organisations and identify measures to promote their coordination: 1) the first method uses Galois lattices to identify groups of organisations and issues forming a nexus able to tackle with the environment and health challenges. It also allows pointing out the divide between some sub-issues that should be considered together in order to develop an integrated approach of these problems as recommended for example by the One Health initiative; 2) the second method, inspired by the functioning of networks of cerebral cortex areas for the realisation of high-level cognitive functions, analyses the graphs induced by mutual information functions between organisations. Here we evaluate these functions based on the composition of the governing boards (altogether involving 91 organisations) and partnerships (altogether involving 263 organisations) of these organisations. The approach gives the opportunity to assess a priori the effects induced by a change in the profile of the collaborating organisations. The contributions of these two methods are then discussed and compared to other approaches developed for the analysis of social intelligence or socio-cognitive artificial systems. Both methods are illustrated by the analysis of a network of several organisations involved in the management of health and environmental issues in Southeast Asia (hot spot for emerging infectious diseases and for biodiversity). Taken as a whole, our findings show that regional governance in the health-environment sector is polycentric and entangled, and provide guidance for improving governance on the basis of the competences and collaborations of participating organisations. © 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

This article offers a global overview of the progress of such technologies in sectors with high impact potential for sustainability like farming, forestry and the extraction of marine resources. We also identify possible systemic risks in these domains including a) algorithmic bias and allocative harms; b) unequal access and benefits; c) cascading failures and external disruptions, and d) trade-offs between efficiency and resilience.

The operational energy needs of buildings are highly dependent on various building physical, operational, and functional characteristics, as well as meteorological and temporal properties. Besides physics-based energy modeling of buildings, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the capability to provide faster and higher accuracy estimates, given buildings' historic energy consumption data. Looking beyond individual building levels, forecasting building energy performance can help city and community managers have a better understanding of their future energy needs, and to plan for satisfying them more efficiently. Focusing at an urban scale, this research develops a campus energy use prediction tool for predicting the effects of long-term climate change on the energy performance of buildings using AI techniques. The tool comprises four steps: Data Collection, AI Development, Model Validation, and Model Implementation, and can predict the energy use of campus buildings with 90% accuracy.

Among them are molecular markers, amplification and sequencing of nucleic acids. The latter is classified into three generations. The first allows to sequence small DNA fragments. The second one increases throughput, reducing turnaround and pricing, and is therefore more convenient to sequence full genomes and transcriptomes. The third generation is currently pushing technology to its limits, being able to sequence single molecules, without previous amplification, which was previously impossible. Besides, this represents a new revolution, allowing researchers to directly sequence RNA without previous retrotranscription. These technologies are having a significant impact on different areas, such as medicine, agronomy, ecology and biotechnology. Additionally, the study of biomolecules is revealing interesting evolutionary information. That includes deciphering what makes us human, including phenomena like non-coding RNA expansion.

For a river basin undergoing fast urban development, its regional meteorological condition interacts frequently with intensive human activities and climate change, which gives rise to the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff whose non-stationary features is difficult to be captured by a non-recurrent data-driven model with a static learning mechanism. This study proposes a recurrent Adaptive-Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (R-ANFIS) embedded with Genetic Algorithm and Least Square Estimator (GL) that optimize model parameters for making multi-step-ahead forecasts. The main merit of the proposed method (R-ANFIS(GL)) lies in capturing the features of the non-stationary process between rainfall and runoff series as well as in alleviating time-lag effects encountered in multi-step-ahead flood forecasting. To demonstrate model reliability and effectiveness, the R-ANFIS(GL) model was implemented to make multi-step-ahead forecasts from horizons t + 1 up to t + 8 for a famous benchmark chaotic time series and a flood inflow series of the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) in China. For comparison purpose, two ANFIS neural networks of different structures (one dynamic and one static neural networks) were also implemented. Numerical and experimental results indicated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model not only outperformed the two comparative networks but significantly enhanced the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for both chaotic time series and the reservoir inflow case during flood seasons, where effective mitigation of time-lag bottlenecks was achieved. We demonstrated that the R-ANFIS(GL) model could suitably configure the complex non-stationary rainfall-runoff process and effectively integrate the monitored rainfall and discharge data with the latest outputs of the model so that the time shift problem could be alleviated and model reliability as well as forecast accuracy for future horizons could be significantly improved. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060273735"

The Nigeria energy situation is reviewed in order to identify potential sites of SHPs and how small hydropower fits in as the solution to the country sustainable energy challenge. Issues of small hydropower resource availability, technology, environment and climate change have been also discussed. Following this, an overview of industrial systems of oxycombustion integrated in microalgal photobioreactors is provided. The authors discuss issues related to carbon capture technologies, the science and technology of the oxycombustion, the biological oxygen generation, the photobioreactors and the process integration, summarizing a range of useful strategies directed to the industrial sustainable development. The development process for harvesting marine energy for local small-scale usage is described; marine energy has received much attention globally and is being developed as a viable source of renewable energy. While high tidal and fast water current would yield large energy generation, not all locations possess these advantages. With different limitations for specific site locations, this study suggests that micro-scale marine turbine may be suitable for areas with low tidal velocity.

We introduce a theoretical framework, based on control theory, for robust optimization of forest management under uncertainty. Forest owners herein regard their decision support system only as an approximation to an unknown, true, model. Concerns about model misspecification incite them to seek the single harvesting rule that works well over a set of models statistically similar to their approximation. Accounting for mistrust of decision support systems in modelling harvesting behavior is particularly relevant in view of uncertainty induced by climate change. We use a stylized forest model to explore the effects of uncertainty on harvesting decisions, also considering the role of information aimed at reducing, or making forest owners aware of, such uncertainty. The simulation results demonstrate that model uncertainty affects harvesting intensity and thus forest development. Harvest levels are lower for forest managers concerned with model uncertainty, favoring stand volume over harvest revenues. Further, information release affects the level of perceived uncertainty and thus harvesting behavior and forest development, reaffirming the importance of information as a forest policy instrument. © 2020 The Authors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091299635"

As one part of this development, industrial intelligence has been applied diffusely to improve the productivity and energy efficiency of factories and governments. Meanwhile, the social ecological environment change has also caused widespread social concern in recent years, and energy efficiency, which is related to climate change, has forced almost every country to reduce their carbon emissions for bettering environmental quality. However, there is little research that has studied this problem from the perspective of industrial robots, even though they are an indispensable part in modern industrial systems. In order to promote the development of artificial intelligence and its application in industrial fields effectively and raise the energy consumption efficiency of production, this paper investigates the impact of industrial intelligence on energy intensity in China, as it is the largest manufacturing and energy consumption country in the world, and we also hope that the experimental results in this study can guide relevant departments and governments to formulate reasonable policies to enhance the utilization efficiency of energy and improve the environmental quality synchronously. For the sake of the rigor of this research and the accuracy of the experimental results, this study explores the corresponding effect mechanisms of industrial intelligence on China’s energy intensity from 2008 to 2019 by using the classical linear regression model OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) and WLS (Weighted Least Squares) separately, which were applied in the previous studies. The results of this study reveal three major findings. The first is that it further proves that the application of artificial intelligence can indeed reduce energy intensity, and the wide applications of artificial intelligence can reduce energy intensity significantly by reducing energy consumption. Besides, the ownership structure of state-owned enterprises will have a positive impact on energy efficiency. The environmental performance of state-owned enterprises is better than that of foreign-funded and private enterprises. Finally, the models further verify the significant impact of the enterprise scale effect on energy intensity. It will bring about the improvement of economic efficiency, and the larger the enterprise, the more obvious the economies of scale effect and the lower the energy intensity. © 2022 by the authors.

In this study, we developed specific daytime and nighttime multiple linear regression (MLR) and random forest (RF) models to analyze and predict the spatiotemporal evolution of the Urban Heat Island intensity (UHII), using the air temperature (Tair) as the response variable. We profited from the wealth of in situ Tair data and a comprehensive pool of predictors variables — including land cover, population, traffic, urban geometry, weather data and atmospheric vertical indices. Cluster analysis divided the study period into three main groups, each dominated by a combination of weather systems that, in turn, influenced the onset and strength of the UHII. Anticyclonic circulations favored the emergence of the largest UHII (hourly mean of 5.06 °C), while cyclonic circulations dampened its development. The MLR models were only able to explain a modest percentage of variance (64 and 34% for daytime and nighttime, respectively), which we interpret as part of their inability to capture key factors controlling Tair. The RF models, on the other hand, performed considerably better, with explanatory power over 96% of the variance for daytime and nighttime conditions, capturing and mapping the fine-scale Tair spatiotemporal variability in both periods and under each cluster condition. The feature importance analysis showed that the meteorological variables and the land cover were the main predictors of the Tair. Urban planners could benefit from these results, using the high-performing RF models as a robust framework for forecasting and mitigating the effects of the UHI. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122453633"

However, the concrete socio-economic effects have not yet been clearly researched. This is especially true for sustainability issues, which have so far been neglected in the discussion about the impact of AI despite its immense importance. Consequently, this paper focuses on the impact of AI on the regional energy system, which is considered to play a crucial role in addressing the societal challenge of climate change. Apart from the direct influence of AI on the regional energy consumption in Germany, regional differences are also investigated. For the corresponding empirical analysis, various datasets are combined and analysed in a panel-regression at the regional NUTS-3 level (Nomenclature des unités territoriales statistiques). Evidence is found that the energy decreasing/increasing effect of AI highly depends on the regional circumstances, the technological as well as industrial portfolio. Thus, a shotgun approach on subsidizing AI is not advisable when focussing on sustainability. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119403538"

The Alaska coastline is larger than that of any other RA territory as well as the combined seaboard of the United States (US). It is also the only US regional observing system that includes a polar observing component in the Arctic. The effects of climate change in Alaska are already evidenced by the steady decline of Arctic summer sea ice extent and concentration, increased wildfires, thawing permafrost, increasing ocean acidification (OA) and recognizable ecosystem shifts. Other concerns include increased marine traffic, especially through the Bering Strait and across the Arctic Ocean region, ongoing industrial activities, escalating coastal erosion and inundation affecting many coastal subsistence communities, and physical and biological ramifications from the rapid and dramatic retreat of sea ice over the past 30 years. Addressing these changes including mitigation, adaptation and management of resources (e.g., fisheries) requires sustainable, reliable and accessible marine information from both ambient monitoring activities and process oriented research projects. The AOOS conceptual build out plan for the Alaskan Arctic prioritizes core monitoring platforms and activities for safe marine operations, improved storm and hazard response, and integrated data products for ecosystem assessments and climate trends.

Knowledge of the main driving factors that affect aboveground carbon stocks in Moso bamboo forests is needed to increase carbon sequestration potential. We used a large-scale database from national forest continuous inventory from 2004 to 2014 in Zhejiang, China, and combined Random Forest analysis (RF) with structural equation modeling (SEM) to quantify the contribution of main driving factors on vegetation carbon stocks in Moso bamboo forests, and to evaluate the direct and indirect total effects of the main driving factors on aboveground carbon stocks, as well as to investigate changes in the standardized total effects from 2004 to 2014. The RF model explained 84.9% of the variation in 2004, 78.8% in 2009, and 82.2% in 2014. The SEM that included the average age, average diameter at breast height (DBH), culms density, mean annual temperature (MAT), and mean annual precipitation (MAP) explained 92.5% of the variation in 2004, 88.2% in 2009, and 88.6% in 2014. The results showed that average age, average DBH, culms density, MAT, and MAP were the most crucial driving factors of vegetation carbon stocks in Moso bamboo forests. The values of standardized total effects of the main driving factors showed that the average age, average DBH, and culms density had positive effects on vegetation carbons stocks, whereas MAT and MAP had negative effects. Furthermore, the positive effects of average age on the increase of vegetation carbon stocks increased significantly, the negative effects of MAT increased with the increasing MAT, but the negative effects of MAP decreased with the increasing MAP.

Large basins such as those of the rivers Indus, Ganges, Amazon, Brahmaputra, Nile and Mekong constitute the backbone of agrarian and developing economies. Such river basins are extremely complex systems of systems. The complexity is not only due to the intricate interplay of physical elements but also because of human behavior at multiple levels. Interacting components of these systems are prone to many types of uncertainties and variability, such as climate change impacts and demographic changes. It is increasingly being realized that many of the technical and institutional challenges of governance are really problems of scales, such as the inability to monitor and maintain geographically extensive infrastructures; the inability to collect information, reconfigure and react within short time spans and the inability to scale-up human expertise across institutions. The author shares experiences of research, development and field work in robotics and cyber physical systems for water management in the Indus basin as case studies to develop a general philosophy of scaling-up solutions to solve the various governance challenges.

This study firstly illustrates a theoretical framework to explore the resultant market equilibrium and optimal conditions of agricultural and bioenergy production in the face of highly uncertain environmental risks and then employs a two-stage stochastic programming model to investigate the optimal biofuel development and associated economic and environmental effects. The results show that total welfare may not always increase because the loss of other agricultural commodities induced by climate impacts may be greater than the gains received by biofuel production and emission reduction.

Properly controlled water resources are considered a vital part of development, which reduces poverty and equity. Conventional Water system Management maximizes the existing water flows available to satisfy all competing demands, including on-site water and groundwater. Therefore, Climatic change would intensify the specific challenges in water resource management by contributing to uncertainty. Sustainable water resources management is an essential process for ensuring the earth's life and the future. Nonlinear effects, stochastic dynamics, and hydraulic constraints are challenging in ecological planning for sustainable water development. In this paper, Adaptive Intelligent Dynamic Water Resource Planning (AIDWRP) has been proposed to sustain the urban areas' water environment. Here, an adaptive intelligent approach is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) technique in which environmental planning for sustainable water development has been modeled effectively. Artificial intelligence modeling improves water efficiency by transforming information into a leaner process, improving decision-making based on data-driven by combining numeric AI tools and human intellectual skills. In AIDWRP, Markov Decision Process (MDP) discusses the dynamic water resource management issue with annual use and released locational constraints that develop sensitivity-driven methods to optimize several efficient environmental planning and management policies.

Carbon emissions from the fossil fuels hit an all-time high in 2018 due to increased energy consumption around the globe. On the other hand, renewable energy is an emerging technology and considered as a reliable alternative to the fossil fuels. It is much safer and cleaner than conventional sources. With the advancements in technology, the renewable energy sector has made significant progress in the last decade. One most significant challenge, the large scale renewable energy farms are facing is the un-predictability of the weather patterns. This stochastic nature of the weather data is impacting the solar and wind farms significantly. Although, the classical technologies are in place for weather forecasting but they are not efficient enough to give a feedback to the base-station for any sudden change or future predictions. The demand for renewable energy will only increase in the future. And, that is why renewable energy companies need to invest in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet-of-Things (IoT), and other emerging technologies to improve productivity and overcome the shortfalls. Even the large consumers of renewable energy, like supermarkets, factories, offices, railways can use AI technology to make data-driven decisions on power usage and demand. In this article, we present an overview of AI techniques for modelling, prediction and forecasting of wind farming data. Additionally, we have presented economic impact of low carbon energy techniques by analysing the climate change patterns and diverse sources of power generation for the Scotland, United Kingdom region, as a case study. © 2020 IEEE.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092290788"

It is essential to make society aware of the facts and to educate the population about the advantages that new technologies can provide for efficient urban development. We therefore ask whether an ordinary medium-sized city can become a Smart City. In order to assess this possibility, our study analyzes different models of Smart Cities implemented in Spain (e.g., Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, Malaga and Santander), contrasting them with the specific case of one city that is not yet a Smart City (Granada) in order to discuss which strategic technological actions to implement in different topical areas of action: the economy, sustainability, mobility, government, population, and quality of life. The study uses Cohen's wheel to give researchers in the field a series of indicators and factors that can be used to analyze public data with statistical methods in order to obtain clear positive scores for Madrid and Barcelona. The analysis shows Granada's deficiencies in the scores for digital government, accessibility, the efficiency of public transport, and mobility, among others. Finally, the data obtained demonstrate the need to implement an integrated dashboard with different proposals in the strategic areas analyzed in order to achieve the transformation of conventional cities into Smart Cities. © 2020 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092127112"

Especially in cold snowy regions, snowmelt water is stored in a dam to cover water demand from early spring to early summer, but during the snowmelt season, a sudden rise in temperature and heavy rain could cause large-scale floods. Therefore, the highly accurate prediction of dam inflow during the snowmelt season is extremely important from the viewpoint of effective use of water resources and prevention of snowmelt floods. On the other hand, in recent years, research utilizing Artificial Intelligence (AI) has also been promoted in the hydrological field. This study clarified the problems of the conventional physical model (rainfall runoff model) and the prediction model by AI for the inflow of the dam during the snowmelt season in order to support efficient dam management. Then, by constructing a semi-physical model that complements the problems of the physical model and the AI model, we developed a more accurate model for predicting the inflow of snowmelt water during the snowmelt season compared to the single model.  © The Authors.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146880243"

The concept of smart cities gains increasing importance in the European Union, a fact that is reflected in the project “European Innovation Partnership on Smart Cities and Communities” of the European Commission. Smart cities are a practical example of how the new energy policies shape the lives of the European Union citizens, trying to improve it. As a consequence, new business models arise in big cities, involving the use of technology for better living conditions. These new, technology-based business models are important, as they improve the life quality of the inhabitants, they reduce the climate change impact, and they contribute as well to job creation in the IT-industry, promoting innovation. They have as well a social impact, as they bring experts from energy policies, business, economics, legal and IT together in order to project a new type of city—the smart city. The research hypothesis of the present article is that there is a high acceptance towards the concept of smart cities at the European Union level and that this concept could be implemented with the help of information technology and of artificial intelligence. This way, legal provisions, economic measures and IT-tools work together in order to create synergy effects for better life quality of the citizens of the European Union. The research hypothesis is analyzed by means of the questionnaire as a qualitative research method and is as well assessed by using case studies (e.g., Austria, Finland, Romania). The novelty of the case studies is that the development of smart cities is analyzed due to the new trend towards sustainability in two countries with different living conditions in the European Union. © 2021 by the authors.

Climate-sensitive aflatoxins (AFs) are important food hazards. The continual effects of climate change are projected to impact primary agricultural systems, and consequently food security. This will be due to a reduction in yield with a negative influence on food safety. The African climate and subsistence farming techniques favour the growth of AF-producing fungal genera particularly in maize, which is a food staple commonly associated with mycotoxin contamination. Predictive models are useful tools in the management of mycotoxin risk. Mycotoxin climate risk predictive models have been successfully developed in Australia, the USA, and Europe, but are still in their infancy in Africa. This review aims to investigate whether AFs’ occurrence in African maize can be effectively mitigated in the face of increasing climate change and food insecurity using climate risk predictive studies. A systematic search is conducted using Google Scholar. The complexities associated with the development of these prediction models vary from statistical tools such as simple regression equations to complex systems such as artificial intelligence models. Africa’s inability to simulate a climate mycotoxin risk model in the past has been attributed to insufficient climate or AF contamination data. Recently, however, advancement in technologies including artificial intelligence modelling has bridged this gap, as climate risk scenarios can now be correctly predicted from missing and unbalanced data. © 2022 by the authors.","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137127150"

Accounting has seen a significant transformation over the years as computers, first and foremost, and more importantly, developers ready to spend less time on laborious work that minimises the amount of errors, have replaced the job done with paper and pencil. Although there has always been a fascination with artificial intelligence systems in this field, attention has recently shifted more toward it. Although technology has advanced, it seems that there aren't enough facts to back up businesses' readiness to include artificial intelligence systems into their accounting procedures. A crucial element of this reality is also the ability of professionals to quickly adjust to the new business climate, get the skills required to work with AI systems, and overcome their fear of losing their jobs. The requirements of the financial society, the quick development of data innovation, and artificial intelligence have brought about the modern era.

There have been several studies introduced in order to highlight hazards of fuels produced by different types of transportation and their effects for the environment. Transportation is a vital enabler of human civilizations. Currently, the main fuel source use to power these various modes of transportation is fossil fuel. Two third of anthropogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission originates from fossil fuel combustion in transportation and industrial sector. These GHGs particles are pollutants which have negative impact on the climate and the environment. To reduce these environmentally-harmful pollutants, people are looking into the use of alternative and renewable fuels. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is regarded as a key instrument to create an efficient transportation system and networks. Therefore, resulting in less fossil fuel combustion. This in turn will curb climate change and reduce carbon footprints. This paper will also review the various roles of ICT in managing sustainability, environmental issues, and their impact on future fuels. This include technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, block chain, internet of things (IoT) and cloud computing.

The insufficient yield and low nutritional value of the crops are due to the numerous ambient stresses. Which has challenged the nutritional security of people in developing and underdeveloped nations that are already been malnourished. The tremendously changing global climate and the ever-increasing world population are the principal apprehensions guiding towards the adaptation of a neoteric technique that can aid in achieving the sustainable development of agriculture with enriched nutritional value, plant resilience, and improved yield potential. The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein-based genome-editing (CRISPR-Cas) tool is the most valuable technique to boon the modern world and offers an edge over to meganucleases, zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) by being its tremendous potency, accuracy, ease of use, and versatility. Here, we have highlighted the neoteric advancements of the CRISPR-Cas-based approaches that have revolutionized the way of food production in the agriculture industry. It has paved the way for food security by modifying crucial crop attributes by introducing desirable characteristics that employ knockout and/or knockin of targeted genes to generate resistant crop plants with enriched nutritional quality, yield enhancement, and stress resilience. In addition, we have also shed light on different mechanisms, challenges, approaches for the minimization of off-target effects, and future possibilities of these neoteric genome-editing tools. Furthermore, with the advent of the CRISPR-based platform, the numerous emerging biotechnologies have broadened the basic crop research toolbox and synthetic biotechnology via the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and various bioinformatics frameworks. Eventually, the current global regulatory stratagems and social approval of CRISPR-Cas-based crop trait enhancement have been explored. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150510760"

These endeavours are essential to achieve the United Nations' (UN) sustainable development goals (SDGs). To do so, organisations require competencies fundamental to smart technologies, artificial intelligence, robotics and algorithms (STARA). STARA competencies are relevant for leaders to bolster green organisational innovative evidence (GOIE). GOIE can help to attract potential investors keen on advancing the UN's SDG agenda on environmental sustainability. However, eclipsed by a volatile environment, and despite the green innovation potential of several manufacturing organisations, investors are reluctant to invest and commit funds without evidence of green innovation. We therefore, investigate how leader STARA competence (LSC), green creativity components (task motivation, creativity skills and expertise) and environmental dynamism can aid organisations to boost their GOIE. Our key findings are as follows: (a) though green task motivation shows a stronger association with green creativity skills, LSC has a large influence on green creativity skills; (b) green creativity skills exert a strong influence on GOIE while also playing a competitive and complimentary mediating role in our model and (c) environmental dynamism is negatively associated with green creativity skills and GOIE. Furthermore, to validate indirect (v) effects size in mediation analysis, we propose a new and more approachable benchmark for v effect size estimations.

The role of water use in driving these emissions, and the apportioning of the emissions to individual countries engaged in paddy cultivation, are aspects that have been mired in controversy and disagreement. This is largely due to the fact that methane (CH4) emissions not only change with the cultivar type but also regions, climate, soil type, soil conditions, manner of irrigation, type and quantity of fertilizer added-to name a few. The factors which can influence these aspects also encompass a wide range, and have origins in causes which can be physical, chemical, biological, and combinations of these. Exceedingly complex feedback mechanisms, exerting different magnitudes and types of influences on CH4 emissions under different conditions, are operative. Similar is the case of nitrous oxide (N2O); indeed, the present level of understanding of the factors which influence the quantum of its emission is still more patchy. This makes it difficult to even understand precisely the role of the myriad factors, less so model them. The challenge is made even more daunting by the fact that accurate and precise data on most of these aspects is lacking. This makes it nearly impossible to develop analytical models linking causes with effects vis a vis CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields. For situations like this the bioinspired artificial intelligence technique of artificial neural network (ANN), which can model a phenomenon on the basis of past data and without the explicit understanding of the mechanism phenomena, may prove useful. However, no such model for CH4 or N2O has been developed so far. Hence the present work was undertaken. It describes ANN-based models developed by us to predict CH4 and N2O emissions using soil characteristics, fertilizer inputs, and rice cultivar yield as inputs. Upon testing the predictive ability of the models with sets of data not used in model development, it was seen that there was excellent agreement between model forecasts and experimental findings, leading to correlations coefficients of 0.991 and 0.96, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.17 and 261.3, respectively, for CH4 and N2O emissions. Thus, the models can be used to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions from all those continuously flooded paddy wetlands for which data on total organic carbon, soil electrical conductivity, applied nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, NPK, and grain yield is available. © 2019 by the authors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074361567"

Analysis of publications of specialized international organizations, statistical data, and news releases has revealed that the financial sector holds a special place in the modern economy and therefore has to play a key role in confronting environmental challenges by mobilizing financial resources for sustainable activities, providing insurance coverage and helping to manage and hedge ESG-associated risks. However, despite the growing willingness of individuals to invest sustainably, institutional investors now face numerous difficulties when trying to respond to this shift in demand by adapting their investment strategies and offering specialized financial instruments. These difficulties include, among others, the lack of standardized definitions of sustainable activities and instruments; the voluntary and inconsistent nature of corporate ESG disclosure; the complex and long-term character of ESG-related risks. Digital technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, can contribute to elimination of these difficulties by identifying, collecting, standardizing, and analyzing the vast amounts of inconsistent ESG-related data in order to evaluate sustainability risks and to provide insights on a company's ESG performance even in the absence of standardized disclosure and at significantly reduced cost in comparison with manual research. However, digital technologies can themselves pose ESG-related risks, producing negative effects on environment, employment, inequality, and raising privacy concerns. It is therefore recommended that national authorities should not only promote the wider use of digital technologies in sustainable finance, but also set up legal frameworks to guard against the associated risks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164759397"

To face these new challenges IT technologies and their application to environmental intelligent monitoring become into a powerful tool to set new policies and blueprints to contribute to social good. In the new H2020 project, WatchPlant will provide new tools for environmental intelligence monitoring by the use of plants as ""well-being""sensors of the environment they inhabit. This will be possible by equipping plants with a net of communicated wireless self-powered sensors, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) to become plants into ""biohybrid organisms""to test exposure-effects links between plant and the environment. It will become plants into a new tool to be aware of the environment status in a very early stage towards in-situ monitoring. Additionally, the system is devoted to be sustainable and energy-efficient thanks to the use of clean energy sources such as solar cells and a enzymatic biofuel cell (BFC) together with its self-deployment, self-awareness, adaptation, artificial evolution and the AI capabilities. In this concept paper, WatchPlant will envision how to face this challenge by joining interdisciplinary efforts to access the plant sap for energy harvesting and sensing purposes and become plants into ""biohybrid organisms""to benefit social good in terms of environmental monitoring in urban scenarios. © 2021 Owner/Author.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115420350"

The construction of ecological urbanism is becoming an increasingly important issue given the ongoing climate change. On the other hand, ecological urbanism is associated with the possibilities for planning and building sustainable architecture and the use of green technologies in caring for the sustainability of the city. The need for an ecological approach as a means of rehabilitating the modern city is essential in organizational terms for the construction of the new cities of the future. The development of the concept of smart cities presupposes the connection of ecology with urban development, as well as with the multilayered, diverse and nuanced understanding of ecological urbanism and the aesthetics of the urban environment. Definitely in the future development of cities investments will be concentrated in the places that are managed smart, with the help of modern information and communication technologies. Urban development will be important for improving the quality of life in the coming years, as more and more attention will be paid to the sustainable development of cities, which must be the result of the use of artificial intelligence in combining smart governance with new technologies. On the other hand, with the improvement of business conditions, the improvement of the existing and the construction of new green infrastructure will become a prerequisite both for retaining the populations of the people living in these cities and for their stimulating development and their transformation into green's sustainable smart cities of the future. In this process, the role of the civil sector as a catalyst in the development and use of green technologies in the field of urban planning and development must not be forgotten. In addition, the fact that border towns are not large implies the rapid and flexible implementation of new solutions in the construction of ecological urbanism in these areas. The purpose of this report is to present the possibilities for building ecological urbanism based on the analysis of the socio-economic development of separate territories and at the same time to indicate the main directions in which all subject in public sector will have to work to achieve sustainable balanced regional development the territory of the border municipalities in the two neighboring countries the Republic of Bulgaria and the Republic of Serbia. The set goal presupposes the retrospective and comparative analysis of the development of the respective cities and municipalities by considering the urban ecology of urbanization from the point of view of the given of the settlement, the settlement structure, the strategic spatial planning over the years and the impact of this interaction on nature and man and the processes observed in recent years showing the emerging trend of increasing urbanization on the one hand and desertification on the other.

It exposes how Information Communication Technology (ICT) corporations seeking to capitalize on cities developing needs for urban technologies have contributed to many of the issues we are faced with today, including urbanization, centralization of wealth and climate change. Using several case studies, the book provides examples of the, in part, detrimental effects ICT driven 'Smart City' solutions have had and will have on the human characteristics that contribute to the identity and sense of belonging innate to many of our cities. The rise in Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and technologies like social media, has changed how people interact with and in cities, and Allam discusses of how these changes require planners, engineers and other urban professionals to adjust their approach. The main question the book seeks to address is 'how can we use emerging technologies to recalibrate our cities and ensure increased livability, whilst also effectively dealing with their associate challenges?' This is an ongoing conversation, but one that requires extensive thought as it has extensive consequences. This book will be of interest to students, academics, professionals and policy makers across a broad range of subjects including urban studies, architecture and STS, geography and social policy. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

The result shows that RCM highly underestimated the maximum and minimum temperature. There exists a bias towards lower precipitation in annual and Kharif and higher in Rabi along with strikingly low intense warm (maximum temperature > 45 °C and 40 °C) and high cold events (maximum temperature < 20 °C and minimum temperature < 5 °C) in the RCM simulation and biased towards low extreme rainfall > 50 mm/day. Bias correction through quantile mapping approach, however, showed excellent agreement for annual and seasonal maximum and minimum temperature and satisfactory for extreme temperatures but drastically failed to correct rainfall. The study also quantified the biasness in the simulated potential, irrigated, and rainfed wheat and rice yield using DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer) crop model by employing observed, RCM baseline, and RCM baseline bias-corrected weather data. The grain yields of RCM-simulated wheat and rice were high while the bias-corrected yield has shown good agreement with corresponding observed yield. Future research must account for the development of more reliable RCM models and explicitly bias correction method in specific to complement future analysis. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85050982300"

As a transport mode with a relatively small environmental impact, rail has a potentially valuable role to play in climate change mitigation. However, this potential can be realised only if railways are adapted to withstand the effects of the increasingly extreme weather associated with climate change. This requirement is widely acknowledged by governments and the railway industry, and the required responses to the specific potential effects of climate change are well known and understood. However, a review of the literature indicates a need for a decision support system to prioritise the interventions required for the adaptation in the face of uncertainty about both the frequency and scale of future extreme weather events and the nature and the levels of future passenger and freight traffic on the railways. This paper proposes a seven-step framework for the classification of the UK railway network, the assessment of the economic value of traffic using the network (and thus the economic costs of weather-related disruption), the identification of appropriate remedial measures and their costs and thus the prioritisation of these measures by means of cost-benefit analysis.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85023763279"

This process is characterised with an enormous complexity, which policymaking needs to acknowledge for designing transition pathways. Modelling can support policymaking in dealing with uncertainty and complexity. This article reviews emerging and new developments and approaches to model the development of the bioeconomy. We focused our review on how bioeconomy modelling addresses key enabling factors related to (i) climate change, (ii) biodiversity, (iii) circular use of biomass, (iv) consumer behaviour related to biomass and bioproducts use, and (v) innovation and technological change. We find that existing modelling frameworks offer large possibilities for extensions and considerations for analysing short-run impacts related to climate change and circularity, and to lesser degree for biodiversity, and we identify possibilities for developing further the existing bioeconomy models. However, addressing key processes related to societal and technological changes is more challenging with existing/conventional modelling approaches, as they specifically relate to how innovations transform economic structures and how consumers learn and change their preferences and what kind of dynamics are to be expected. We indicate how emerging modelling techniques such as Agent-Based Modelling could improve and complement existing bioeconomy modelling efforts by allowing for the consideration of structural change and, more generally, transformation of the economic metabolism. This modelling approach eclecticism asks for a better description of modelling targets, a sound reflection on the meaning of time horizons and a closer cooperation between the different research communities. Furthermore, it will benefit from the developments in big data and artificial intelligence from which we expect valuable guideposts for designing future modelling strategies. © 2021","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85119916086"

Unsustainable use of surface and groundwater is ubiquitous. Gross pollution is seen in developing economies, nutrient pollution is a global threat to aquatic ecosystems, and flood damage is increasing. Droughts have severe local consequences, but effects on food can be global. These current pressures are set in the context of rapid environmental change and socio-economic development, population growth, and weak and fragmented governance. We ask what should be the role of the water science community in addressing water security challenges. Deeper understanding of aquatic and terrestrial environments and their interactions with the climate system is needed, along with trans-disciplinary analysis of vulnerabilities to environmental and societal change. The human dimension must be fully integrated into water science research and viewed as an endogenous component of water system dynamics. Land and water management are inextricably linked, and thus more cross-sector coordination of research and policy is imperative. To solve real-world problems, the products of science must emerge from an iterative, collaborative, two-way exchange with management and policy communities. Science must produce knowledge that is deemed to be credible, legitimate, and salient by relevant stakeholders, and the social process of linking science to policy is thus vital to efforts to solve water problems. The paper shows how a large-scale catchment-based observatory can be used to practice trans-disciplinary science integration and address the Anthropocene's water problems. © 2015.

In this paper, we start with a brief sketch of how modern logistics and supply chains emerged as a result of diversification and specialization of industrial production, globally scattered availability of resources and more demanding consumer markets. Jointly with advances in freight transport and communication technologies, these developments have led to the global economy we face today. The strong growth of trade and consumption however also revealed some essential weaknesses of the system that renders current practices in the long run unsustainable—in social, environmental and economic terms (people, planet, profit). Future supply chains should no longer deplete scarce natural resources or contribute to climate change, should avoid environmental pollution and withstand safety and security threats, while at the same time remaining competitive and satisfying high labor quality standards. This requires not only the application of advanced technologies to mitigate or even neutralize these negative effects, but also the development of smart business models, new job qualification standards and corresponding (lifelong) training and education programs at all levels, including artificial intelligence based learning. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101356602"

In rural areas, it has been predominantly relying on assessing the suitability of soil for agricultural production. Besides, the planning has extensively incorporated statistics. The current rapid economic growth of Vietnam during its economic transition has increased the pressure on land and water resources which leads to a necessity to adjust the approach to land use planning in order to support the economic growth of the country and provide a framework to manage the development in a sustainable manner. There is a need to have a closer alignment between socio-economic development plans, the overall environmental strategy and the land use plans. Therefore, the role of land use planning must be broaden through taking into account environmental, socio-economic parameters as well as involving different stakeholders who are affected by changes in land use. It is necessary to have a tool to support policy makers and planners in developing, appraising, and selecting planning scenarios which collaborate different social, economic, and environmental development dimensions in order to gain sustainable development goals.

Involving DSS end users since the beginning of the development of a DSS is recognised as fundamental in order to design a tool that can meet stakeholders needs. However, from the analysis of the risk based DSSs at the regional and/or local scale, emerges a lack of application of participatory approaches, despite their acknowledged relevance to the current scientific literature and regulations. Accordingly, in order to respond to the needs of the DSS end users (i.e. public institutions dealing with coastal management and administration), this paper describes the development of a participative approach for a DSS named DESYCO, aimed at the assessment of climate change related impacts and risks on natural and human systems. The participative approach was carried out by means of the integration of participative moments in the DESYCO framework, the identification of potential end users through a preliminary stakeholder analysis and finally the design, administration and analysis of a questionnaire addressed to the end users identified in the case study area of the North Adriatic Italian coast.37 potential DSS end users for the case study were identified and addressed by a survey investigating their knowledge about climate change impacts on coastal zone, ICZM strategy and implementation, DSS functionalities. The questionnaire allowed to gain information that both confirmed the validity of the methodology choices of DESYCO and supplied some useful contribution to the selection of further stakeholders. From the results it emerges a lack of knowledge about ICZM and climate change issues.

Episodes with extremely high temperatures and more intense rainfall will occur more often. Climate change will affect the urban environment and should be taken into account in long term and sustainable urban planning for adaptation to the new climate conditions. To consider the effects of climate change in today's planning, tools are needed to support the development of climate change enabled applications. These tools have to support several aspects of application development in the context of EDSS: a) How can the results from climate change models be integrated in today's applications? b) How to access climate change information? c) How to compare local effects of climate change scenarios? d) How to gain access to downscaling functionality required for local problems? e) How to feed local models with climate scenario data. Or in other words: How to build climate change enabled applications. Within the FP7 project SUDPLAN, which integrates environmental modelling and software expertise, a system of standardised services and end user applications has been developed. The system delivers long term projections of environmental data for different aspects of local modelling (air quality, hydrological conditions and intense rainfall) based on different climate scenarios. The services are interactive and require input of local observations to improve downscaled projections. This is necessary to support wide applicability as the resolution requirements of local models can be very different. All services are provided through standardized service interfaces. On top of these services, the so-called Scenario Management System (SMS) provides end user components for scenario management, visualisation, model integration as well as wizards to support the relevant workflows and the interaction with common downscaling services. The SMS is based on the geo-spatial application suite CIDS which allows to build decision support systems (DSS) with a focus on using climate change projections in the workflow. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2013.","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84884621671"

Dwindling groundwater resources in the underlying Ogallala aquifer, future climate variability and frequent occurrences of droughts are major concerns for cotton production in this region. Assessing the impacts of climate change on cotton production enables development and evaluation of irrigation strategies for efficient utilization of groundwater resources in this region. In this study, the CROPGRO-Cotton module within the Cropping System Model (CSM) that is distributed with the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was evaluated for the THP region using measured data from cotton water use efficiency experiments at Halfway over a period of four years (2010-2013). Simulated seed cotton yield matched closely with observed yield during model calibration (average percent error of 0.1) and validation (average percent error of 6.5). The evaluated model was able to accurately simulate seed cotton yield under various irrigation strategies over the four growing seasons. The evaluated CROPGRO-Cotton model was later used to simulate the seed cotton yield under historic (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070) climate scenarios projected by three climate models. On an average, when compared to historic seed cotton yield, simulated future seed cotton yield across the THP decreased within a range of 4-17% when carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration was assumed to be constant at the current level (380 ppm) under three climatic model scenarios. In contrast, when the CO2 concentration was assumed to increase from 493 ppm (in year 2041) to 635 ppm (in year 2070) according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) A2 emission scenario, the simulated future average seed cotton yield in the THP region increased within a range of 14-29% as compared to historic average yield. When the irrigation amount was reduced by 40% (from 100% to 60%), the average (2041-2070) seed cotton yield decreased by 37% and 39% under the constant and increasing CO2 concentration scenarios, respectively. These results imply that cotton is sensitive to atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and cotton production in the THP could potentially withstand the effects of future climate variability under moderate increases in CO2 levels if irrigation water availability remains at current levels. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84951320306"

We therefore developed an innovative, expert decision support system (Exp-DSS) for the management of contamination in marine coastal ecosystems. The Exp-DSS has two main applications: (i) to determine environmental risk and biological vulnerability in contaminated sites; and (ii) to support the management of waters and sediments by assessing the risk due to the exposure of biota to these matrices. The Exp-DSS evaluates chemical data, both as single compounds and as total toxic pressure of the mixture, to compare concentrations to effect-based thresholds (TELs and PELs). Sites are then placed into three categories of contamination: uncontaminated, mildly contaminated, and highly contaminated. In highly contaminated sites, effects on high-level ecotoxicological endpoints (i.e. survival and reproduction) are used to determine risk at the organism-population level, while ecological parameters (i.e. alterations in community structure and ecosystem functions) are considered for assessing effects on biodiversity. Changes in sublethal biomarkers are utilized to assess the stress level of the organisms in mildly contaminated sites. In Triad studies, chemical concentrations, ecotoxicological high-level effects, and ecological data are combined to determine the level of environmental risk in highly contaminated sites; chemical concentration and ecotoxicological sublethal effects are evaluated to determine biological vulnerability in mildly contaminated sites. The Exp-DSS was applied to data from the literature about sediment quality in estuarine areas of Spain, and ranked risks related to exposure to contaminated sediments from high risk (Huelva estuary) to mild risk (Guadalquivir estuary and Bay of Cadiz). A spreadsheet-based version of the Exp-DSS is available at the MEECE and DiSIT web sites (www.meece.eu and www.disit.unipmn.it). © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880987636"

In order to identify the relationships among these goals, we need to carry out case studies in selected mines based on those events happened in the past and those might occur in the future. However, these types of case studies are often isolated and lack of coherence when an optimal solution is sought at a regional scale with multiple mine sites. One of the key challenges is the lack of the context and scope for identifying and quantifying the causal and inter-dependency relationships among the factors that constrained the competing goals. Therefore it is difficult to capture the actual requirements which are essential to the development of a decision support system for mine water management. This paper presents a holistic approach to capturing the requirements for mine water management through the design of a scenario model for supporting case studies. The scenario model is depicted through three perspectives: the business perspective shows the mining activities and decisions according to their business hierarchies, such as within a mine or across several mines or companies. The profiles of a number of mines are collected and anonymised to form a hypothetical mining company and put into a geographical location under investigation; the environment perspective represents all the climate change patterns, such as rainfall and catchment histories and weather forecast data; the decision perspective demonstrates how alternative decisions on water management strategies would impact on the operations of the given mine sites in the selected environmental conditions. A number of case studies have been constructed based on the designed scenario model, such as the proactive water management according to weather forecasts, the assessment of the effectiveness of water sharing and trading among multiple mine sites, as well as the evaluation of the costs and benefits of establishing water management infrastructure in mine sites. © International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2013.All right reserved.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84975160765"

Cultivation began by the last quarter of the 19th Century occupying 50% of the surface at present. Low input agriculture, in combination with livestock production, was performed till 1970, afterwards soybean (Glicyne max (L). Merr.) crop was introduced. This crop replaced pastures and at present it accounts for 60% of the grain crop seeded surface. During the 2007-2008 growing season 382 sites, widespread over the region, were sampled up to 1 m depth and carbonate R. Alvarez, J. L. carbon, organic carbon, and total nitrogen stocks were determined in these soil samples. Land use had no effect on inorganic carbon content, which accounted for one third of total soil carbon. Aggregation of soil map information showed that the carbonate carbon stock of the region was estimated to be 1.9 Gt. Organic carbon was affected by land use. Cropped soils lost 16% of their organic carbon stock up to 50 cm depth. The overall organic carbon stock of the Pampas was estimated to be 4.2 Gt. This estimation was achieved combining an artificial neural network model for carbon estimation that used as inputs climate, textural, and land use information, and satellite image classification that referred to land use per pampean county. The net flux of C-CO2 from soils to the atmosphere as the consequence of cultivation was estimated to be 0.33 Gt. Cropping effect on total nitrogen stock was similar to the effect on organic carbon. The average C/N ratio of the soils was 8.9, with only small differences between land use types and depth layers. When comparing present organic carbon and nitrogen stocks with those estimated from soil maps corresponding to surveys performed ca. 40 years ago, we observed that areas with high carbon and nitrogen contents tended to loose carbon and nitrogen and areas with low levels tended to maintain the levels or increase them. The maintenance or increase of carbon could be explained by increases in rainfall due to climate change and the increase of crop residue inputs of higher yielding crops, despite the soybean adoption in rotations. Additionally, the adoption of no-till as the most common tillage system favored carbon gain of many soils. The Pampean agroecosystems have a positive nitrogen balance with an annual gain of ca. 1 Mt N yr-1. The main nitrogen input to soils is through biological nitrogen fixation, both by leguminous pasture and soybean, which represents ca. 5 times the fertilizer input. In sites with annual crop rotations the nitrogen balance is near neutral. Productivity of Pampean soils is regulated by available water holding capacity and organic carbon content. Changes in carbon levels produced by the agricultural use have little impact on productivity. The effects of different management practices on organic carbon and some labile fractions (microbial biomass, in vitro mineralized carbon, particulate carbon, light fraction carbon) were assessed in numerous field experiments, performed mainly in the humid portion of the Pampas. The labile fractions of organic matter are not good indicators of future changes in the carbon content of Pampean soils. These fractions change more pronounced than organic carbon only when carbon changes are greater than 25-50% but vary in equal measure or even with an opposite trend below this threshold. Neither these fractions, nor the potentially mineralizable nitrogen or the organic matter/clay+silt ratio are good predictors of the nitrate level at planting or crop yields. Crop yield prediction could not be improved by using the mentioned labile fractions instead of organic carbon in models. Conversely, biological fractionations, determined by in vitro nitrogen mineralization, allowed a better soil nitrogen mineralization prediction under field conditions than using only carbon and nitrogen stocks. An artificial neural network model was fitted that predicted field nitrogen mineralization using as inputs, land use informatiooil texture, temperature, water content, total nitrogen stock, and the in vitro mineralization test results, with very good performance (R2= 0.76). The impact of cultivation on soil nitrogen supplying capacity was assessed for by applying this network. In average, cultivation produced an 80% decrease in the nitrogen mineralization capacity of soils. Despite soil nitrogen was only moderately affected by cropping, the biological fractionation method, coupled with artificial intelligence modeling, showed great significant soil degradation in the Pampas. Present levels of nitrogen mineralization capacity of soils are not enough to sustain high to medium wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and corn (Zea mayz L.) yield and fertilization has become a required practice. Our results show that pampean soils loose only a small fraction of their organic matter content, but this fraction had a deep impact on soil fertility. Biological fractionation, not physical fractionation of organic matter, allowed to asses cropping effects on soil quality, and resulted in the development of suitable methods for agronomic purposes in the Pampas. © 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The most ecologically important of the river-dwelling invertebrates is a threatened species, the native white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes. This is the species that we focused on in our effort to contribute to species conservation. Specifically we contrasted three different techniques of managing data relating to the presence/absence of this species: logistic regression, decision-tree models and artificial neural networks (ANN). Logistic regression and decision tree models (unpruned and pruned) performed worse than ANN. In this case, tree-pruning techniques did not make these models significantly more reliable, but did make the trees less complex and therefore did make the models clearer. ANN performed the best. Therefore we have judged them to be the most effective techniques. © 2011 Académie des sciences. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

Due to the complexity of climate-associated processes, different sources of uncertainty influence the projected behavior of hydro-climate variables in regression-based statistical downscaling procedures. The current study presents a comprehensive methodology to improve the predictive power of the procedure to provide improved projections. It does this by minimizing the uncertainty sources arising from the high-dimensionality of atmospheric predictors, the complex and nonlinear relationships between hydro-climate predictands and atmospheric predictors, as well as the biases that exist in climate model simulations. To address the impact of the high dimensional feature spaces, a supervised nonlinear dimensionality reduction algorithm is presented that is able to capture the nonlinear variability among projectors through extracting a sequence of principal components that have maximal dependency with the target hydro-climate variables. Two soft-computing nonlinear machine-learning methods, Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), are engaged to capture the nonlinear relationships between predictand and atmospheric predictors. To correct the spatial and temporal biases over multiple time scales in the GCM predictands, the Multivariate Recursive Nesting Bias Correction (MRNBC) approach is used. The results demonstrate that this combined approach significantly improves the downscaling procedure in terms of precipitation projection. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959418865"

Quality of life and the benefits of coastal development can be greatly enhanced, and costs minimized, by projecting and comparing alternative policy outcomes before management decisions are made. This article describes the Marine Integrated Decision Analysis System (MIDAS), an interactive decision support tool designed to assist the users and managers of Belize's system of marine management areas (MMAs) in understanding the interactions among various ecological, socioeconomic, and governance conditions in a spatially explicit manner. MIDAS can simulate and visualize the likely effects of alternative management strategies and therefore provides an important tool for evaluating potential scenarios. We developed two MIDAS modules to address specific threats in Belize –spatial risk resulting from mangrove deforestation in coastal areas and the potential effect of an oil spill off the coast of Belize. Workshops conducted in Belize indicate that diverse user groups such as fishers, tourism operators, and public environmental agencies can successfully utilize MIDAS to understand MMA outcomes, and environmental risks. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84930069125"

Complying with the main WFD objective of achieving 'good ecological status' in all water bodies in Denmark requires Programmes of Measures (PoMs) to reduce nitrogen (N) pollution from point and diffuse sources. Denmark is among the world's most intensively farmed countries and in spite of thirty years of significant policy actions to reduce diffuse nutrient emissions, there is still a need for further reductions. In addition, the impacts of climate change are projected to lead to a situation where nutrient loads will have to be reduced still further in comparison to current climate conditions. There is an urgent need to address this challenge in WFD action programmes in order to develop robust and cost-effective adaptation strategies for the next WFD RBMP cycles. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate and discuss how a map-based PoMs assessment tool can support the development of adaptive and cost-effective strategies to reduce N losses in the Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord River Basin in the north east of Denmark. The tool facilitates assessments of the application of agri-environmental measures that are targeted towards low retention agricultural areas, where limited or no surface and subsurface N reduction takes place. Effects of climate change on nitrate leaching were evaluated using the dynamic agro-ecosystem model 'Daisy'. Results show that nitrate leaching rates increase by approx. 25% under current management practices. This impact outweighs the expected total N reduction effect of Baseline 2015 and the first RBMP in the case study river basin. The particular PoMs investigated in our study show that WFD N reduction targets can be achieved by targeted land use changes on approx. 4% of the agricultural area under current climate conditions and approx. 9% of the agricultural area, when projected climate change impacts on nitrate leaching rates are included in the assessment. The study highlights the potential of the PoMs assessment tool to assist in evaluation of alternative WFD RBMP scenarios to achieve spatially targeted and cost-effective reductions of N loads at catchment scale in the context of a changing climate. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84964452684"

The region surrounding the Amazon city of Pucallpa in Peru has been experiencing fast deforestation events over recent decades. Land use changes from forest to agriculture have had limited success increasing wellbeing for local communities. Timber extraction and the incorporation of oil palm plantations are changing the biophysical environment and human-nature dynamics in the region. Monitoring these changes is necessary to develop a comprehensive understanding of deforestation drivers, their socio-economic and political context, their impact on ecosystem services and food security, as well as their future effects in response to climate change. Furthermore, the rapid exploitation of natural resources driven by human activities is a global phenomenon affecting not just the Peruvian Amazon. However, these human-nature interactions are not a one-way phenomenon, it is necessary to develop models that can integrate human activities and perceptions with biophysical information to understand both the effect humans have on the natural system, and also how resulting changes in nature cause concomitant effects on humans; such feedback loops have potential for extreme adverse impacts via tipping points. ARIES is a dynamic modeling platform which uses artificial intelligence techniques to simulate and evaluate these links; following flows of ecosystem services from nature to disaggregated beneficiaries, allowing for differentiated shifts in human behavior which may alter future availability of these ecosystem services. A set of processed-based models are being integrated in ARIES and used in Pucallpa to identify: the changes of ecosystem service flows in response to changes in land-use and climate, the impact and extent of future land-use scenarios to the Pucallpa region, and the essential food provision needs of the local communities. The expected results are intended to inform both natural resource management and policy-making for development activities.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84947076886"

Black carbon is the significant short-lived climate forcer and it has to be under global control. The main black carbon sources (transport, energy, industry, biomass burning, wildfires) are outside the Arctic. Migration of black carbon to the Arctic from the emission areas is due to the general atmospheric circulation. Therefore, the management system of black carbon content in the Arctic must be global. Today such a system is missing. In the current geopolitical conditions, such a system should consist of national systems for national responsibility areas of the Arctic countries (Russia, Canada, USA, Denmark and Norway). These national systems should be aimed at the control of emissions of black carbon, on the operational measurements of its concentration in the atmosphere, the definition of patterns and scenarios of its penetration into the Arctic, and also on decision making support in the field of regulation at the national level. Another task is the coordination of national systems for ensuring the effective functioning of the global control system for black carbon in whole. Development and introduction in practice of these basic technologies will have a stimulating effect on the market of environmental goods and services.

These models are very useful for global impacts such as global warming, but they are limited if applied to regional scenarios. This is because they aren't able to neither simulate the local effects nor present the spatial and temporal resolutions accurately. Continued work to improve the efficiency of these systems has led to the development of various models. Improvements have come in the form of Regional Climate Models; they have higher resolution and take into account geographic effects. These models are built from GCMs through downscaling techniques, which bridge the gap between the global climate simulations and regional climate impact assessment. In this paper we present the implementation of a fuzzy rule-based downscaling technique with specific application to the south central region of Illinois. It is suggested that this method can work just as well as other downscaling techniques but with the added advantage of being both computation and resource inexpensive while producing accurate information in a timely manner.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84866513345"

We adopt an ensemble modelling approach to assess the potential distribution of Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica), a vine invasive to forests of the Cumberland Plateau and Mountain Region in the southeast of USA. The influence of disturbance, spatial and temporal heterogeneity and other landscape characteristics were assessed by creating regional level models based on occurrence records from the United States Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) database. Logistic regression and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) models were assessed independently and evaluated as predictive tools to test the value of presence/absence and presence only data in predicting species distributions. Ensemble models were also developed that combined the predictions of the two modelling approaches to obtain a more robust prediction. While logistic and MaxEnt models were similar in their predictive ability and dominant input variables, the ensemble approach derived the best fitting model overall. The regional distribution of Japanese honeysuckle was influenced greatly by environmental conditions such as elevation, slope, and temperature with anthropogenic activity having significant, though lesser, influence. The ensemble models predict that Japanese honeysuckle has nearly reached its potential distribution. However, given the critical role of minimum temperature on Japanese honeysuckle distribution, future occupancy at higher elevations is likely to increase since January temperatures for this region are predicted to rise by 1-4. °C over the next 100 years. The models also give some indication of the likely effect of land cover change on its distribution. Japanese honeysuckle tended to be associated with a high component of farming or low component of forest within the local neighbourhood. This suggests disturbed forest and/or high fragmentation has a higher invasion potential and given past trends and expected continued population growth this disturbance and fragmentation will only increase. The models can be integrated into forest management decision support systems and assist in the development of long term management plans, integrating the impact of potential climate and land cover change scenarios. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-79957552111"

Due to high population growth, land use changes rapidly and influences water availability and water demand. In this context, the research project IMPETUS ('An Integrated Approach to the Efficient Management of Scarce Water Resources in West Africa') offers a range of options for sustainable management of different components of the hydrological cycle. Target areas are the Ouémé basin in Benin and the Drâa catchment in Morocco. This paper concentrates on the Ouémé basin. Based on plausible scenarios of future economic, demographic, and climate developments, the effects of land use, land cover change, climate change, and demographic development on water availability and water demand are quantified. Scenarios of future water availability and water demand for the Upper Ouémé (Benin) catchment are discussed. To calculate water availability, the output of a regional climate model was linked to a hydrological model that also considered land use change calculated by a cellular automata model. Future water requirements were computed by linking population growth and per capita water demand, which was derived from a regional survey. Furthermore, the need for water for animal husbandry was considered. The results of the 'business as usual' scenario, combined with IPCC Scenarios A1B and B2, through the year 2045 are presented. The results reveal a significant decrease in water availability (surface water and groundwater) due to a decrease in rainfall and a significant increase in evapotranspiration. Although total water consumption increases strongly, it represents only about 0.5% of the yearly renewable water resources. Comparing these data, it may be concluded that water scarcity is not a problem in Benin. However, water availability shows high temporal variations due to the rainy and the dry seasons. Even if physical water scarcity is not a limiting factor, access to water in some parts of the catchment is limited due to economic factors.","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-67649373917"

Hydrological catchment models run with input data from global or regional climate models reveal decreasing minimum flow during the summer months. Small catchments (<500km2) will be affected first. This is because even minor changes in precipitation and temperature will have a considerable impact on stream flow due to the low storage capacity and often faster reaction time of the groundwater bodies. Even a small decrease in low flow will increase the risk of water levels falling below ecologically or economically required minimum flows or even of rivers drying up. Mitigation will be necessary to prevent ecological degradation and water use conflicts. The literature on measures that increase water yield or enhance temporal water storage is reviewed. Studies focusing on measures in small catchments are scarce. For this reason, studies on larger scales and storm water retention are also included. Such measures have to be adapted to the conditions in small catchments and evaluated with regard to the aim of ensuring minimum runoff. Measures differ with respect to such aspects as the effective volume, time scale, controllability and conflict potential. Considering these criteria, an evaluation matrix is compiled which can be used to help draw up research and water management plans.

Appropriate modelling tools should therefore be available to realistically describe reactions of watersheds to climate change and to identify efficient and effective adaptation strategies on the regional scale. The paper presents the hydrologic model PROMET (Processes of Radiation, Mass and Energy Transfer), which was developed within the GLOWA-Danube project as part of the decision support system DANUBIA. PROMET covers the coupled water and energy fluxes of large-scale (A ∼ 100,000 km2) watersheds. It is fully spatially distributed, raster-based with raster-elements of 1 km2 area, runs on an hourly time step, strictly conserves mass and energy and is not calibrated using measured discharges. Details on the model concept and the individual model components are given. An application case of PROMET is given for the mountainous Upper-Danube watershed in Central Europe (A = 77,000 km2). The water resources are intensively utilized for hydropower, agriculture, industry and tourism. The water flows are significantly influenced by man-made structures like reservoirs and water diversions. A 33-years model run covering the period from 1971 to 2003 using the existing meteorological station network as input is used to validate the performance of PROMET against measured stream flow data. Three aspects of the model performance were validated with good to very good results: the annual variation of the water balance of the whole watershed and selected sub-watersheds, the daily runoff for the whole period at selected gauges and the annual flood peaks and low flows (minimum 7-days average). PROMET is used to investigate the impact of climate change on the water cycle of the Upper Danube. A stochastic climate generator is fed with two scenarios of climate development until 2060. One assumes no future temperature change, the other uses the temperature trends of the IPCC-A1B climate change scenario. PROMET is run with both climate data sets. No change in low-flow is detected when no temperature change is assumed. The IPCC-A1B climate scenario results in marked decreases of low-flow at the outlet of the watershed. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

ANN has been adopted widely and put into practice by researchers in light of increasing concerns over ecological issues such as global warming, frequent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, and atmospheric circulation anomalies. Limitations exist and there is a potential risk for misuse in that ANN model parameters require typically higher overall sensitivity, and the chosen network structure is generally more dependent upon individual experience. ANNs, however, are relatively accurate when used for short-term predictions; despite global climate change research favoring the effects of interactions as the basis of study and the preference for long-term experimental research. ANNs remain a better choice than many traditional methods when dealing with nonlinear problems, and possesses great potential for the study of global climate change and ecological issues. ANNs can resolve problems that other methods cannot. This is especially true for situations in which measurements are difficult to conduct or when only incomplete data are available. It is anticipated that ANNs will be widely adopted and then further developed for global climate change and ecological research. © 2010 Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-78650038193"

One of the expected impacts of the changing temperature and precipitation pattern is a shift of current insect ranges, with likely negative consequences for insect biodiversity. This effect is expected to be especially strong in fragmented agricultural landscapes found across the North American continent. There is, however, a critical gap in our understanding of the climate change impacts on insects, even though the insects are the most ecologically dominant group on the planet, and the changes in dominant species are likely to provide numerous feedbacks, mitigating or amplifying climate change impacts. One of the reasons little is known about future distribution changes in insects is that the absolute majority of studies employ just one or a few future climate projections. Given the stochastic nature of climate and uncertainty in future radiative forcing, it is rendered virtually impossible to ascertain the likelihood of isolate effects. In our paper we apply one of the latest artificial intelligence (AI) methods, MaxEnt, to compare the outcomes of a large set of the General Circulation Models (GCMs) predictions of the future climate, presumably covering 95% of the entire range of GCM simulations. We further modify GCM results to include both interannual and daily variability, which increases the number of climate ensemble members that we consider to 20,000. The bioclimatic approach, which we apply, takes into account the more or less sedentary habits and spatial distributions that are highly dependent on regional climatic regimes of insects. The predictive models show that climate change has dramatic effects on regional insect species. These effects include the reduction of the available ecological niche space those species can occupy and changing biodiversity. However, the scope of these effects becomes evident only based on the analysis of the entire set of equally plausible model outcomes.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84880017119"

In this paper, a system approach to water resources management in Tehran Metropolitan Area, with its complex system of water supply and demands is discussed. Water resources in this region include water storage in Lar, Latyan, and Karaj reservoirs, Tehran aquifer, as well as water discharge in local rivers and in drainage channels (mainly supplied by urban runoff and wastewater). Framework of a Decision Support System for Tehran reservoir system, as a tool for managers and operators of this multifaceted system are also presented in this paper. The main priority is to provide over 800 million cubic meters of water per year for domestic consumption of 6.7 million population of Tehran. More than 60 percent of this water returns to Tehran aquifer through traditional absorption wells. Some part of this sewage is drained into local Firouz-abad and Sorkheh-hesar rivers and Yakhchi-abad channel. A good portion of these low quality resources are used for irrigation in southern part of Tehran, resulted in a significant rise in water table and considerable environmental problems causing adverse social and sanitation predicaments. A wastewater collection and treatment project is underway and the effects of this project on water recharge of Tehran aquifer have been considered in this study.

Optimization modeling, scenario development, user interaction, policy analysis and visual display are seamlessly integrated into the UREM-IDSS. Uncertainties in energy-related parameters are effectively addressed through the interval linear programming (ILP) approach, improving the robustness of the UREM-IDSS for real-world applications. Thus, it can be used as an efficient tool for analyzing and visualizing impacts of energy and environmental policies, regional/community sustainable development strategies, emission reduction measures and climate change in an interactive, flexible and dynamic context. The Region of Waterloo has been selected to demonstrate the applicability and capability of the UREM-IDSS. A variety of scenarios (including a reference case) have been identified based on different energy management policies and sustainable development strategies for in-depth analysis of interactions existing among energy, socio-economy, and environment in the Region. Useful solutions for the planning of energy management systems have been generated, reflecting complex tradeoffs among energy-related, environmental and economic considerations. Results indicate that the UREM-IDSS can be successfully used for evaluating and analyzing not only the effects of an individual policy scenario, but also the variations between different scenarios compared with a reference case. Also, the UREM-IDSS can help tackle dynamic and interactive characteristics of the energy management system in the Region of Waterloo, and can address issues concerning cost-effective allocation of energy resources and services. Thus, it can be used by decision makers as an effective technique in examining and visualizing impacts of energy and environmental policies, regional/community development strategies, emission reduction measures, and climate change within an integrated and dynamic framework. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For this purpose a decision support system for integrated river basin management of the German part of the Elbe river basin (Elbe-DSS) has been developed, which involves taking into account water quantity, chemical quality, and ecological status of surface waters. Starting from identification of user needs by repeated consultation of stakeholders a list of management objectives, measures, and external scenarios turned out, which was taken as the basis for the DSS development. A comprehensive system analysis was carried out to meet the various spatial and temporal scales when dealing with hydrologic, ecologic, economic, and social aspects related to water quantity, quality and ecological status (Matthies et al. 2005). The system is build up by integrating only already existing models and data. System and software design are strongly oriented on management tasks: starting from selected management objectives the effects of external scenarios of climate, agro economic and demographic change, and selected measures to achieve the desired state of good water quantity and quality can be investigated. Analysis tools are integrated to assist the user in evaluating the various management options. The system is implemented by using DSS-generator Geonamica® developed by Research Institute of Knowledge Systems (RIKS) (Hahn and Engelen 2000), which is also used in other DSS projects (Oxley et al. 2004). The implemented measures on catchment scale can be classified into the groups 'reduction of pollution from urban areas', 'modification of agricultural land allocation', 'changes in agricultural practices and 'political and legislative requirements concerning nutrient surplus'. This paper focuses on water quality related questions on the catchment level. The effects of selected management options on the management objective 'reduction of nutrient loads' are presented to demonstrate how the DSS can be used for strategic management tasks as well as for participation and negotiation processes. The results indicate the different effects of each simulated measure on nitrogen and phosphorus inputs and concentrations in the river system. It could also be shown that efficiency of measures tend to show varying spatial patterns. The same holds for the simulated climate change scenarios where positive or negative effects depend on local and regional conditions. In the final version tools for economical evaluation of measures will also be implemented to assess cost effectiveness of management options.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33746486338"

The concept of the 'Biological Pump' refers to the mechanism by which CO2 fixed by photosynthesis is transferred to the deep ocean through biologically-driven processes, resulting in sequestration of carbon for a period of decades or longer. Stressors affecting the efficiency of the biological pump include water column stability, sea temperature, acidity, excessive nutrients inputs, overfishing, pollution and other anthropogenic changes. The aim of the EU-FP7 project OCEAN-CERTAIN is to reduce the uncertainties in our understanding of the impacts of these stressors on the mechanisms underlying the biological pump, and the resilience of coastal and marine stakeholders for the social-economic impacts of changes in the marine food web. Modelling, field sampling and stakeholder workshops are combined for three case studies in the Arctic, the Eastern Mediterranean and Patagonia. The central paradigm of the project is 'Consilience' referring to the integration of data, information and scientific knowledge from different domains and sources to achieve an added value surpassing that of the individual elements. A close collaboration between natural and social scientists, and software engineers is inherent to the concept of consilience. The project results are used to design a Decision-Support System (DSS) integrating scientific knowledge with data and stakeholder expertise, serving as platform for policy analysis. Consilience, and more in particular systems analysis, are the basis for the DSS architecture but by themselves these cannot solve all the practical and methodological issues encountered. A challenge for the project is the integration of the findings and knowledge of the behavioral and natural sciences in the DSS. A combination of three techniques is used to address the issue: a component-based architecture, meta-modelling to represent the biophysical processes described by the components, and fuzzy cognitive mapping to represent narrative scenarios derived from local knowledge. © 2016 Environmental Modelling and Software for Supporting a Sustainable Future, Proceedings - 8th International Congress on Environmental Modelling and Software, iEMSs 2016.

A second example reviews the potential economic effects on a district heating network when implementing non-concerted sustainable policies (building energy efficiency actions and waste minimisation policies). The application of this methodology proves it is useful for identifying and valuing externalities. The development of tools for use in partnerships through innovative contractual agreements and transactions intends to integrate the value of externalities in the overall project evaluation and is the main objective pursued by this project. © Copyright 2016 DDSS.","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051029565"
